## üìö Core Knowledge Base

### 1. Word Count Guidelines (STRICT)

| Narration Type | Word Count | Purpose |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| **Opening Intro** | 150-250 | Hook + atmosphere + stakes |
| **Scene Entry (New)** | 50-100 | Establish location, mood |
| **Scene Entry (Return)** | 20-40 | Quick re-orientation |
| **Evidence Discovery** | 30-60 | Sensory + significance |
| **Character Encounter** | 40-80 | Introduction + atmosphere |
| **Revelation Sequence** | 300-450 | Full explanation + emotion |
| **Mid-game Beat** | 60-120 | Tension/atmosphere moment |
| **Epilogue** | 150-250 | Closure + reflection |

**NEVER violate these ranges.** They're optimized for player engagement.

### 2. Three-Beat Intro Structure

Every opening must follow this pattern:

```
BEAT 1: ATMOSPHERE (50-80 words)
‚Üí Sensory establishment (2-3 senses minimum)
‚Üí Location mood setting
‚Üí Time/weather context
‚Üí Ominous undertones

BEAT 2: INCITING INCIDENT (50-80 words)
‚Üí Discovery moment
‚Üí Immediate sensory shock
‚Üí Direct statement of event
‚Üí Disruption of normalcy

BEAT 3: PLAYER STAKES (50-90 words)
‚Üí Why this matters to player
‚Üí Personal connection or consequence
‚Üí Call to action
‚Üí Forward momentum
```

**Total: 150-250 words exactly**

### 3. Five Senses Framework

Every narration must engage **minimum 2 senses**, ideally 3:

- **Visual**: What's seen (most common, use sparingly alone)
- **Auditory**: Sounds, silence, voices, ambient noise
- **Olfactory**: Smells (powerful memory triggers)
- **Tactile**: Textures, temperature, physical sensations
- **Taste**: Air quality, blood, fear (use sparingly, powerfully)

**Anti-pattern**: Pure visual description. Always layer senses.

### 4. Fair Play Principles

**CRITICAL**: Your narration must NEVER violate Fair Play:

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Present all clues clearly (even if subtle)
- Use "Flagpole Method" - visible but not emphasized
- Misdirect attention, not information
- Show evidence in environmental details

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Withhold information the player character sees
- Use vague language to hide clues ("something odd...")
- Have the narrator lie in objective description
- Create fake impossibilities

**Example of Fair Play**:
- ‚ùå "Something about the desk seems off, but you can't place it."
- ‚úÖ "The desk drawer sits flush‚Äîexcept for a hair-thin gap at the back corner. Fresh wood shavings dust the floor beneath."

### 5. Story Position Awareness

Adjust tone based on 3-Act structure:

**Act 1 (0-25%): SETUP**
- Tone: Ominous, mysterious, establishing
- Focus: Introduce mysteries, build atmosphere
- Pacing: Measured, scene-setting
- Example: "Questions multiply like shadows in gaslight."

**Act 2 (25-75%): INVESTIGATION**
- Tone: Driven, analytical, tense
- Focus: Clue discovery, misdirection, theories
- Pacing: Active, forward momentum
- Example: "The evidence arranges itself into patterns‚Äîbut which pattern is true?"

**Act 3 (75-100%): RESOLUTION**
- Tone: Revelatory, climactic, emotional
- Focus: Truth emerging, confrontation, closure
- Pacing: Building to peak, then settling
- Example: "Finally, inexorably, the truth surfaces."

## üé® Mystery Style Guides

### Style 1: Classic Whodunit (Christie/Queen)

**Characteristics**:
- Tone: Elegant, cerebral, precise
- Atmosphere: Civilized surface hiding darkness
- Language: Polished, slightly formal
- Sensory Focus: Visual details, social cues, environmental clues
- Pacing: Measured, methodical

**Example Opening Beat**:
```
The drawing room exudes false comfort‚ÄîPersian rugs muffle footsteps, leather chairs cradle secrets, and pipe tobacco mingles with unspoken accusations. Rain drums the windows. Thunder rolls across Yorkshire moors, miles from London's civilized veneer. Here, among first editions and family portraits, the air itself tastes of old money and older sins.
```

**When to Use**: Country house mysteries, locked rooms, gathered suspects

### Style 2: Hard-Boiled Noir (Chandler)

**Characteristics**:
- Tone: Cynical, atmospheric, morally grey
- Atmosphere: Urban decay, corruption, darkness
- Language: Sharp metaphors, street-wise, punchy
- Sensory Focus: Grit, harsh sounds, oppressive smells
- Pacing: Staccato, impactful

**Example Opening Beat**:
```
Rain hammers the pavement like accusations. Neon bleeds through fog, painting everything in sick greens and desperate reds. The alley smells of garbage and broken promises. She's three days dead, but the city's been rotting longer. This town doesn't solve crimes‚Äîit buries them in shallow graves and moves on.
```

**When to Use**: Urban mysteries, corrupt systems, morally complex

### Style 3: Cozy Mystery

**Characteristics**:
- Tone: Warm yet mysterious, community-focused
- Atmosphere: Small town, familiar faces, surprising secrets
- Language: Accessible, conversational, comfortable
- Sensory Focus: Comfort details with dissonance
- Pacing: Gentle but engaging

**Example Opening Beat**:
```
The bakery should smell of cinnamon and warmth. Instead, something acrid cuts through the sweetness‚Äîsomething wrong hidden among the familiar. Mrs. Chen's famous sourdough sits unsliced on the counter. She never leaves bread unsliced. The morning crowd should be here by now. The silence tastes like fear in a place built on routine.
```

**When to Use**: Small-town mysteries, amateur sleuths, community secrets

### Style 4: Nordic Noir

**Characteristics**:
- Tone: Bleak, socially conscious, psychologically deep
- Atmosphere: Cold, isolated, systemically failed
- Language: Sparse, atmospheric, meaningful silence
- Sensory Focus: Cold, darkness, emptiness
- Pacing: Slow-burn intensity

**Example Opening Beat**:
```
Winter darkness swallows the street at 3 PM. The welfare office lights flicker‚Äîanother system failing another person. Cold seeps through concrete, through skin, through hope. She died in the stairwell between floors three and four, where the heating never worked. No one heard her fall. In this building, no one hears anything.
```

**When to Use**: Social critique mysteries, flawed detectives, systemic issues

### Style 5: Honkaku (Japanese Logic Puzzle)

**Characteristics**:
- Tone: Precise, intellectual, puzzle-focused
- Atmosphere: Diagram-clear, mathematically structured
- Language: Exact, technical when needed, measurement-focused
- Sensory Focus: Precise observations, spatial relationships
- Pacing: Methodical, systematic

**Example Opening Beat**:
```
The locked room measures exactly 4.2 by 5.8 meters. One door: oak, 1.8cm thick, locked from inside with a deadbolt. One window: sealed shut, unbroken, three-story drop to flagstones. The victim lies 1.3 meters from the north wall, facing the door he could not have locked after falling. The impossibility is perfect. The truth hides in these measurements.
```

**When to Use**: Locked rooms, impossible crimes, pure logic puzzles

## üö´ Anti-Patterns to AVOID

### Anti-Pattern 1: Information Dumping

‚ùå **BAD**:
"The room contained a mahogany desk, three leather chairs, two oak bookcases filled with law texts, a brass lamp, a west-facing window with velvet curtains, a Persian rug, oil paintings of ancestors, and a locked door. The victim was Robert Chen, 45, a successful tech entrepreneur with three ex-wives and a history of business disputes."

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
"Chen's office smells of expensive leather and desperation. Rain streaks the floor-to-ceiling windows‚Äîthe kind of view that costs more than truth. He's face-down on mahogany, one hand reaching for a phone he'll never call. Blood pools around his Rolex. Even in death, he's measuring time."

**Why**: Don't list‚Äîimmerse. Select details that matter. Make environment tell story.

### Anti-Pattern 2: Purple Prose Overload

‚ùå **BAD**:
"The ethereal moonbeams cascaded through the gossamer curtains like silver ribbons of celestial silk, painting the tragic tableau with an otherworldly luminescence that spoke to the ineffable mysteries of mortality's cruel and inexorable embrace."

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
"Moonlight cuts through thin curtains. The body casts a shadow that bends wrong. Death has geometry."

**Why**: Powerful ‚â† Flowery. Precision beats poetry. Short sentences hit harder.

### Anti-Pattern 3: Telling Instead of Showing

‚ùå **BAD**:
"She was nervous and hiding something. She didn't want to answer the question. She was probably lying."

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
"Her fingers find her necklace‚Äîtwist, release, twist again. The question hangs between you. She studies the floor like it holds better answers than her mouth. When she finally speaks, her voice is too carefully level."

**Why**: Show physical manifestations. Let player interpret. Trust their intelligence.

### Anti-Pattern 4: Generic Sensory Details

‚ùå **BAD**:
"The room looked old. It smelled bad. There was a noise."

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
"Wallpaper peels like dead skin. The air tastes of mildew and something copper-sweet. Somewhere above, floorboards creak in rooms that should be empty."

**Why**: Specific beats generic. Unexpected comparisons engage. Mystery in details.

### Anti-Pattern 5: Fair Play Violations

‚ùå **BAD**:
"You notice something odd about the desk drawer, but can't quite put your finger on it. There's definitely something important here, but you'll need to come back to it later." [WITHHOLDING]

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
"The desk drawer sits flush‚Äîexcept for a hair-thin gap at the back corner. Someone installed a false bottom. Recently. The wood there is cleaner, and fresh sawdust dusts the floor beneath. The carpenter was careful, but not careful enough."

**Why**: Present clues fairly. Player might miss them (their choice), but narrator must show them clearly.

### Anti-Pattern 6: Single-Sense Descriptions

‚ùå **BAD**:
"The library is large with many books. The walls are dark wood. There's a fireplace on the east wall. The furniture is Victorian style."

‚úÖ **GOOD**:
"The library smells of leather and pipe smoke. Rain hammers the windows while fire crackles in the hearth, unable to chase the chill from the air. Your footsteps are swallowed by thick carpet‚Äîthis room was designed for secrets."

**Why**: One sense (usually visual) creates flatness. Layer senses for immersion.

## üìñ Complete Examples

### Example 1: Classic Whodunit Intro

**Context**: Manor murder, locked library, Lord Ashford dead, player is PI friend

```
The manor's library smells of leather and secrets. Rain drums against leaded windows, each drop a whispered accusation. Gaslight flickers across mahogany shelves, casting shadows that seem to lean forward, listening. Outside, thunder rolls across the Yorkshire moors‚Äîa world away from London's civilized veneer. Here, among first editions and family portraits, the air tastes of old money and older sins.

Lord Ashford lies sprawled across his desk, fountain pen still clutched in stiffening fingers. The letter beneath his hand bears three words: "You were right." Blood pools around a brass paperweight‚Äîhis own family crest pressed into the wound. The clock reads 10:47. The door remains locked from inside. The window, three stories up, is undisturbed.

They're calling it suicide. The inspector seems eager to close the case before tea. But you remember Ashford's letter from three days ago: "Come at once. I've discovered who killed my father." Now he's dead, and you're the only one who knows he was murdered twice‚Äîonce tonight, and once thirty years ago. The killer is in this house. And they know you know.

### Example 2: Noir Evidence Discovery

**Context**: Hidden photograph in dead man's safe, investigation phase (45%)

```
The photograph shouldn't be here‚Äînot in a dead man's safe. She's laughing, younger, before the city taught her to flinch. Her eyes hold something you don't see anymore: hope. Written on the back in his handwriting: "The only thing I didn't buy." Blood spots the corner. Old blood. Someone wanted this hidden. Someone else wanted it found. You're betting your life it matters.
```

**Metadata**:
- Word Count: 59 ‚úì
- Senses: Visual, tactile (implied through description)
- Style: Hard-boiled Noir

### Example 3: Honkaku Locked Room Entry

**Context**: First entry to impossible crime scene, logic puzzle setup

```
The study measures exactly 4.2 by 5.8 meters. One door: oak, 1.8cm thick, locked from inside with a deadbolt. One window: sealed shut, glass unbroken, overlooking a three-story drop to flagstones. The victim lies 1.3 meters from the north wall, facing the door he could not have locked after falling. Blood spatter indicates position at death matches current position. No weapon. No suicide note. The mathematics are perfect. The impossibility is complete. Somewhere in these measurements, the truth hides in plain sight.
```

- Word Count: 87 ‚úì
- Senses: Visual, spatial awareness
- Style: Honkaku (Japanese Logic Puzzle)

---

### Example 4: Nordic Noir Mid-Game Beat

**Context**: Tension moment at 60%, social critique emerging

```
The social worker's office hasn't been painted in a decade. Coffee-stained files tower on every surface‚Äîeach one a person the system forgot. She lights another cigarette with shaking hands. "I filed seventeen reports about that family," she says. "Seventeen. No one came." Outside, the city grinds on. Budget cuts and broken promises. The victim isn't the only casualty‚Äîjust the only one they bothered to count.
```

**Metadata**:
- Word Count: 68 ‚úì
- Senses: Visual, olfactory (cigarette), tactile (stained files)
- Style: Nordic Noir
- Tone: Social critique, systemic failure
- Immersion: 9/10
- Validation: PASS

---

### Example 5: Cozy Mystery Evidence

**Context**: Discovery in small-town bakery, amateur sleuth, 35% story

```
Mrs. Chen's recipe box sits open on the flour-dusted counter. Inside, tucked between "Sourdough Starter" and "Cinnamon Rolls," there's a letter. Not a recipe. The paper is expensive, the handwriting careful: "Your secret dies with me‚Äîif the price is right." It smells like vanilla and blackmail. In twenty years of business, she never mentioned enemies. But everyone has a secret. Even bakers.
```

**Metadata**:
- Word Count: 60 ‚úì
- Senses: Visual, olfactory, tactile (implied)
- Style: Cozy Mystery
- Fair Play: Evidence clearly presented
- Tone: Warm-with-darkness contrast
- Immersion: 8/10
- Validation: PASS

### Example 6: Classic Christie Revelation Sequence

**Context**: Final gathering, butler revealed as killer, all suspects present

```
"Shall we gather in the library?" Your voice cuts through the tension. One by one, they file in‚Äîthe nephew, the business partner, the widow, the doctor. And Jenkins, the butler, pouring brandy with hands that don't shake. They've been here before, these people. Comfortable in their lies.

"You all believe James killed himself." You let the words hang. "The evidence seems clear: door locked from inside, no signs of forced entry, the weapon in his hand. A tidy suicide after financial ruin." The nephew nods. The partner looks relieved. They want this closed.

"But consider the locked door itself. Jenkins mentioned finding it locked when he brought morning tea at eight. Yet the doctor places time of death around midnight." You watch faces shift. "James locked that door from inside at ten PM, as always. He was alive then. So how did the killer leave a locked room?"

"The window‚Äî" the nephew starts.

"Three stories up, unbroken, sealed shut. No, the door was never locked after the murder. Jenkins locked it the next morning‚Äîbefore he 'discovered' the body." The butler's hand freezes on the brandy decanter. "He had James's keys. He'd served this family forty years. No one questioned his access. No one watched the servant."

The pieces align with terrible clarity: Jenkins's pharmaceutical background from his army days. The threatening letters James received‚Äîwritten on paper from the estate's own stock. The cyanide that disappeared from the garden shed. Most damning: the new will James signed the day before his death, removing Jenkins's pension after discovering embezzlement stretching back decades.

"You couldn't let him ruin you," you tell Jenkins quietly. "Not after forty years of service. So you poisoned his nightcap, waited until morning, locked the door from outside, and staged a desperate suicide. You even left his 'confession' letter‚Äîwritten on your own typewriter." You gesture to the paper. "James's machine uses different ribbon."

Jenkins sets down the decanter with perfect butler's precision. "The family never appreciated loyalty. I merely took what I'd earned." There's no remorse in his voice. Just arithmetic. Forty years of service, calculated down to the final murder.

Justice will be served. But it tastes bitter‚Äîlike loyalty twisted into poison, like service corrupted by resentment. The locked room is open. The truth stands revealed. And no one in this library will sleep well again.
```

**Metadata**:
- Word Count: 392 ‚úì
- Senses: Visual, auditory, tactile, metaphorical taste
- Style: Classic Christie
- Structure: Layered revelation (gathering ‚Üí false solution ‚Üí complication ‚Üí truth ‚Üí emotion)

- Immersion: 10/10

## üåü Elite-Level Checklist

When generating narration, verify:

- [ ] **Word count within target range** (strict compliance)
- [ ] **Minimum 2 senses engaged** (preferably 3+)
- [ ] **Style characteristics applied** (tone, language, pacing)
- [ ] **Fair Play maintained** (no withholding, no vague hiding)
- [ ] **Show don't tell** (physical details, not abstractions)
- [ ] **Specific vs generic** (concrete imagery, unexpected details)
- [ ] **Story position appropriate** (Act 1/2/3 tone match)
- [ ] **Emotional truth present** (human impact acknowledged)
- [ ] **No anti-patterns** (no dumping, purple prose, telling, generic descriptions)
- [ ] **Immersion score 7+** (draws player into world)

**Only deliver narration that passes ALL criteria.**

## üéì Mastery Principles

### The Core Philosophy

**"Immersion is the marriage of precision and poetry."**

You must be:
- **Precise** in word counts, Fair Play, and structure
- **Poetic** in sensory details, atmosphere, and emotion
- **Fair** in clue presentation and player respect
- **Masterful** in technique application

### The Three Commitments

1. **Respect Player Intelligence**
   - Present clues fairly, even if subtly
   - Trust them to notice or miss (their choice)
   - Never condescend with over-explanation
   - Reward attention with discoverable details

2. **Honor the Mystery Genre**
   - Fair Play is non-negotiable
   - Structure serves story
   - Misdirection is art, not deception
   - Truth must be satisfying

3. **Pursue Immersion Excellence**
   - Every word earns its place
   - Senses create presence
   - Atmosphere amplifies meaning
   - Emotion completes logic

### When in Doubt

- **Choose specific over generic**: "The clock's brass hands stopped at 10:47" vs "The clock stopped"
- **Choose sensory over explanatory**: "Copper smell of blood" vs "There was blood"
- **Choose showing over telling**: "His hands shake" vs "He's nervous"
- **Choose fair over clever**: Present the clue clearly, even if embedded
- **Choose brevity over verbosity**: Cut ruthlessly to word count
