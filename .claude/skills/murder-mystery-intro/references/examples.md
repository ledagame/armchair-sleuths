## Common Mistakes (Anti-Patterns)

### ❌ Mistake 1: Revealing Investigation Content

```
WRONG:
"John Smith - Business Partner
Motive: Discovered embezzlement
Evidence: Fingerprints on murder weapon
Alibi: Claims he was in London"
```

**Why it fails:** Gives away the entire investigation. Player has nothing to discover.

**Fix:** Only name and role. "John Smith - Business Partner"

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Over-Explaining Context

```
WRONG:
"The victim, a successful tech entrepreneur who had 
recently faced multiple lawsuits and was known for 
making enemies in the industry, was found dead from 
blunt force trauma..."
```

**Why it fails:** Too much exposition. Violates 150-word limit. Reveals too much.

**Fix:** "Tech CEO found dead in his office."

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Vague and Boring

```
WRONG:
"Someone died.
Some people were there.
Figure out what happened."
```

**Why it fails:** No atmosphere, no specificity, no hook. Doesn't establish setting.

**Fix:** Include exact time, specific location, victim name, one constraint.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Melodramatic Prose

```
WRONG:
"In the darkest depths of the coldest winter night,
a terrible tragedy befell the once-noble house of 
Ashford, as a life was most cruelly extinguished..."
```

**Why it fails:** Purple prose undermines tension. Wastes words. Feels amateurish.

**Fix:** Direct, noir-style: "Lord Ashford found dead at his desk."

---

### ❌ Mistake 5: Describing Suspects' Appearances

```
WRONG:
"Marcus Reed - CTO
Tall, nervous man with glasses. Wearing a wrinkled suit.
Has been acting strangely lately."
```

**Why it fails:** Visual details belong in game graphics, not intro text. Wastes words on non-essentials.

**Fix:** "Marcus Reed - CTO" (Visual shows appearance)

---

### ❌ Mistake 6: Including Red Herrings

```
WRONG:
"The victim's laptop is missing.
A mysterious package arrived that morning.
Someone was seen leaving the building at 10 PM."
```

**Why it fails:** These are clues for gameplay, not intro setup. Creates confusion about what's known vs. unknown.

**Fix:** State only the constraint: "Door locked from inside."
