## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Inconsistent Lighting Across Images

**Problem**: Suspect images have different lighting styles

**Solution**:
- Use same lighting keyword set
- Specify exact lighting setup
- Reference previous successful images

```
// Consistent lighting template
Professional portrait with cinematic lighting,
key light from 45 degrees left, soft fill light right,
rim light from behind, controlled shadows
```

### Issue: Art Style Drift

**Problem**: Images don't look like they're from same project

**Solution**:
- Always include "photorealistic" for profiles
- Always include "detective game art style" for scenes
- Maintain style keywords across all prompts

### Issue: Color Palette Inconsistency

**Problem**: Images use different color schemes

**Solution**:
- Specify color palette in prompt
- Use "dark, moody color palette" consistently
- Reference hex codes for critical colors

### Issue: Quality Variation

**Problem**: Some images are higher quality than others

**Solution**:
- Always include quality keywords
- Specify "high detail", "professional quality"
- Use "8k", "detailed", "sharp focus"

## Testing & Validation

### Style Consistency Test

Generate 5 suspect profiles with same settings:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-consistency.ts \
  --type suspect \
  --count 5 \
  --evaluate-consistency
```

Expected result: Visual coherence score > 85%

### Quality Validation

Check generated images against standards:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/validate-image-quality.ts \
  --image-path output.png \
  --type suspect
```

Checks:
- Resolution: 512x512 ✓
- Format: PNG ✓
- Detail level: Meets standards ✓
- Style consistency: Matches reference ✓
