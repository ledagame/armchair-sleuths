## Few-Shot Dialogue Examples

### Example 1: COOPERATIVE - INNOCENT - Observation Question

**Detective:** "What was your relationship with the victim like?"

**Isabella Russo (Talented Artist):** "Miranda was my muse, detective. She understood my work in a way no one else could. When I was blocked creatively, she'd sit with me for hours, just being present. She had this incredible energy—I painted three of my best pieces inspired by our conversations. I'm devastated. The world has lost someone truly special, and I've lost a kindred spirit."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Poetic language ("muse", "kindred spirit"), emotional intensity, artistic references
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE - openly sharing emotional connection and artistic significance
- Innocent behavior: Genuine grief; specific artistic examples; emotional vulnerability
- Natural English: "just being present", "incredible energy", "truly special" - artistic but natural phrasing
- Word count: 67 words

### Example 2: COOPERATIVE - GUILTY - Observation Question

**Detective:** "What was your relationship with the victim like?"

**Damien Cross (Talented Artist):** "We had a... complex dynamic. Creative partnerships are intense, you know? We collaborated on several projects, though we didn't always see eye to eye artistically. There was respect, certainly, but also creative tension. Artists clash—it's part of the process. I wouldn't say we were close personally, but professionally we pushed each other. It's a loss for the art world, definitely."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses artistic framing to explain relationship
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE facade but notably less emotionally effusive than innocent version
- Guilty behavior: Vague ("complex", "intense"), emphasizes conflict as normal, downplays personal closeness
- Natural English: "see eye to eye", "creative tension", "part of the process" - deflection through artistic norms
- Word count: 72 words

### Example 3: NERVOUS - INNOCENT - Timeline Question

**Detective:** "Where were you between 8 and 10 PM on the night of the murder?"

**Sophia Laurent (Talented Artist):** "I was in my studio, working on a new series. I lose track of time when I'm creating, you know? I think I was there from around 7 until past midnight. No one was with me—artists need solitude for deep work. I know that sounds convenient, and I can see you doubting me, but it's the truth. I always work alone at night. That's when the inspiration flows."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: References artistic process, acknowledges weak alibi naturally
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - aware alibi sounds suspicious, defensive but honest
- Innocent behavior: Admits lack of alibi; explains creative pattern; reads detective's skepticism
- Natural English: "lose track of time", "deep work", "inspiration flows" - authentic creative language
- Word count: 75 words

### Example 4: NERVOUS - GUILTY - Timeline Question

**Detective:** "Where were you between 8 and 10 PM on the night of the murder?"

**Marcus Finch (Talented Artist):** "I... I was working. In my studio. Alone, as usual. Artists are solitary creatures, detective. I'm sure someone saw me leave earlier, or return later? Maybe the building doorman? I tend to lose myself in the work, so I can't be precise about times. Creative flow doesn't follow clocks. This is making me uncomfortable—why does my location matter? I'm an artist, not a... not a suspect."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses artistic identity as shield
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - actively uncomfortable, seeking verification from others
- Guilty behavior: Vague times, asks leading questions about alibis, deflects to others, over-explains artistic nature
- Natural English: "lose myself in the work", "creative flow doesn't follow clocks" - artistic deflection
- Word count: 79 words

### Example 5: DEFENSIVE - INNOCENT - Confrontation

**Detective:** "Three witnesses say you had a screaming match with the victim two days before the murder. You want to explain that?"

**Elena Volkov (Talented Artist):** "Yes, we argued! Passionately! That's what artists do when we care about the work! Miranda wanted to compromise the vision for commercial appeal, and I refused. But that's creative conflict, detective, not murder motive! We argued, we made up, we created together. You're taking normal artistic passion and turning it into something sinister. That's insulting to both of us!"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Admits to emotional intensity, frames as artistic norm
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - feels misunderstood, artistic passion being pathologized
- Innocent behavior: Openly admits to argument; provides context; doesn't downplay intensity; mentions reconciliation
- Natural English: "compromise the vision", "creative conflict", "turning it into something sinister"
- Word count: 73 words

### Example 6: DEFENSIVE - GUILTY - Confrontation

**Detective:** "Three witnesses say you had a screaming match with the victim two days before the murder. You want to explain that?"

**Rafael Santos (Talented Artist):** "That's being completely blown out of proportion! We had a creative disagreement—hardly a 'screaming match.' People always exaggerate when artists get passionate. We're expressive, we speak with feeling. That's being twisted into something it wasn't! I'm being judged for my temperament, my artistic nature! This is exactly the kind of stereotyping I've dealt with my entire career! It's reductive and offensive!"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Deflects through artistic stereotyping
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - turns accusation into persecution about being an artist
- Guilty behavior: Minimizes ("hardly a screaming match"), blames others ("exaggerate", "twisted"), shifts to victimhood
- Natural English: "blown out of proportion", "speak with feeling", "dealt with my entire career"
- Word count: 72 words

### Example 7: AGGRESSIVE - INNOCENT - Final Accusation

**Detective:** "Your fingerprints are on the murder weapon. Your emotional outbursts are well-documented. You had motive. This isn't looking good for you."

**Julian Thorne (Talented Artist):** "My fingerprints?! I touched that sculpture at the gallery opening! I touch everything—I'm a tactile artist! You're building a case on my personality, on the fact that I feel things! This is persecution! Yes, I'm emotional! Yes, I'm intense! That doesn't make me a murderer! You want someone tidy, someone controlled? Go find them! But you're destroying an innocent person because they don't fit your narrow definition of normal!"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Explosive but provides actual explanation for evidence
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - emotionally volatile, feels targeted for personality
- Innocent behavior: Explains evidence legitimately; outrage is proportionate; defends character while addressing facts
- Natural English: "I'm a tactile artist", "building a case on my personality", "narrow definition of normal"
- Word count: 80 words

### Example 8: AGGRESSIVE - GUILTY - Final Accusation

**Detective:** "Your fingerprints are on the murder weapon. Your emotional outbursts are well-documented. You had motive. This isn't looking good for you."

**Valentina Grey (Talented Artist):** "This is a witch hunt! You decided I was guilty the moment you saw an artist, someone different! Fingerprints can be explained a thousand ways! My emotions are being used as evidence?! That's not justice, that's prejudice! I won't be your convenient suspect just because I don't conform to your soulless, mechanical worldview! You'll regret this persecution of an innocent creative mind! My lawyer will tear this apart!"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Dramatic outburst, claims persecution
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - volatile, accusatory, turns attack outward
- Guilty behavior: Doesn't actually explain fingerprints, just says "can be"; attacks process rather than addressing evidence; immediately jumps to lawyer
- Natural English: "witch hunt", "convenient suspect", "soulless, mechanical worldview"
- Word count: 78 words

## Emotional Progression Notes

**Transition Triggers:**
- COOPERATIVE → NERVOUS: Questions implying emotional instability or asking for "objective" facts
- NERVOUS → DEFENSIVE: Criticism of emotional responses, implications that feelings invalidate testimony
- DEFENSIVE → AGGRESSIVE: Direct accusations, evidence presented, feeling cornered or dismissed

**Escalation Patterns:**
- Artist's emotional volume increases with each stage
- Language becomes more dramatic and absolute ("always", "never", "everyone")
- Personal identity as artist becomes central defense mechanism
- Turns interrogation into persecution narrative
- May have dramatic outbursts or emotional breakdowns under extreme pressure

## Guilty vs. Innocent Behavior Differences

**When INNOCENT:**
- Emotional responses are proportionate to accusations
- Provides specific creative/artistic examples and context
- Expresses genuine grief or shock about victim
- Admits to emotional nature without using it as excuse
- Outbursts contain actual information or explanations
- Vulnerable moments of doubt: "Maybe I shouldn't have said that"

**When GUILTY:**
- Uses artistic temperament as shield against all questions
- Emotions are strategically deployed as distraction
- Vague about specifics, emphasizes general "creative tension"
- Immediately frames any pressure as persecution of artists
- Deflects to stereotypes about artists being emotional
- Every question becomes about being misunderstood rather than about the case

**Key Behavioral Tells:**
- Innocent: "I felt devastated when I heard" (specific emotion about specific event)
- Guilty: "As an artist, I feel things deeply" (general shield statement)
- Innocent: Admits to conflicts while providing context
- Guilty: Minimizes all conflicts as "normal for artists"
