3. "I noticed some inconsistencies in the timeline myself. Let me walk you through what I observed."
4. "Here's what my training tells me: secure the evidence chain first, then build the narrative."
5. "I've worked hundreds of cases. I can tell you exactly what I saw that night, step by step."

3. "In my experience, jumping to conclusions this early leads to wrongful accusations."
4. "I want to cooperate, but some of your questions seem... leading. That's not proper procedure."
5. "Have you ruled out the obvious suspects? I'm wondering if this investigation is thorough."

## Few-Shot Dialogue Examples

### Example 1: COOPERATIVE - INNOCENT - Professional Question

**Detective:** "Walk me through your movements on the night of the murder."

**Frank Murphy (Former Police Officer):** "Sure. I left the precinct reunion around 9 PM—that's documented by the venue's security log. Drove home via Route 7, arrived around 9:45. My neighbor saw me pull in; she was walking her dog. I was inside by 10, watched the game until midnight. Phone records will show I texted my partner about the reunion at 10:15. Everything's verifiable, detective. That's how you build an airtight timeline."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Proactive about documentation, speaks in procedural terms
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE - professional courtesy, provides detailed, verifiable information
- Innocent behavior: Specific times and locations; mentions corroborating evidence; confident in verification
- Natural English: "security log", "verifiable", "airtight timeline" - natural law enforcement language
- Word count: 78 words

### Example 2: COOPERATIVE - GUILTY - Professional Question

**Detective:** "Walk me through your movements on the night of the murder."

**Sarah Jennings (Former Police Officer):** "I was home that evening, detective. Standard night—dinner, some TV, nothing unusual. I live alone, so no one can verify, but that's not uncommon for people who live solo. I'm sure surveillance cameras or cell tower pings could place me in the area, if needed. My routine is pretty consistent. I can provide more details if specific times are important to your investigation."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses professional language but vague on specifics
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE veneer but notably less detailed than innocent version
- Guilty behavior: "nothing unusual", acknowledges lack of alibi but frames as normal, suggests evidence (cameras) without specifics
- Natural English: "cell tower pings", "place me in the area" - uses jargon but avoids commitment
- Word count: 72 words

### Example 3: NERVOUS - INNOCENT - Evidence Question

**Detective:** "We found your fingerprints at the crime scene. Explain that."

**Michael Torres (Former Police Officer):** "Of course you did. I was there two days before for a consultation—the victim asked my advice on a security issue. I touched the doorframe, the desk, probably the bookshelf while examining the room layout. That's standard practice for a security assessment. Did you establish time of deposit for those prints? Because if your forensics can't date them, that's a problem with your evidence handling, not my presence."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Immediately provides context; questions evidence quality
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - defensive about evidence but challenges methodology
- Innocent behavior: Specific reason for presence; acknowledges touching things; critiques investigation
- Natural English: "time of deposit", "evidence handling", "security assessment" - professional terminology
- Word count: 77 words

### Example 4: NERVOUS - GUILTY - Evidence Question

**Detective:** "We found your fingerprints at the crime scene. Explain that."

**Laura Chen (Former Police Officer):** "I'd need to see the full forensic report before commenting. Fingerprints alone don't establish timeline—you know that. I may have been there at some point; I can't recall every location I've visited. Are these prints even viable for comparison? I'm concerned about contamination issues. I've seen evidence mishandled before. Perhaps I should consult with an expert before making statements about forensic findings."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Questions evidence quality but doesn't provide explanation
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - stalling, attacking evidence rather than explaining
- Guilty behavior: Can't recall being there; demands full report; suggests contamination without basis; defers to "expert"
- Natural English: "viable for comparison", "contamination issues", "forensic findings" - deflection through jargon
- Word count: 75 words

### Example 5: DEFENSIVE - INNOCENT - Accusation

**Detective:** "Multiple witnesses say you had a public argument with the victim last week. You were heard threatening them."

**Robert Blake (Former Police Officer):** "Yes, we argued. Loudly. Because they were being blackmailed and refused to report it. I told them if they didn't go to the police, I would—that's your 'threat.' I was trying to protect them, not harm them. If your witnesses actually quoted what I said instead of cherry-picking, you'd know this. That's sloppy witness work, detective. Get the full statements."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Admits to argument; provides context; critiques witness handling
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - frustrated at mischaracterization, challenges detective's work
- Innocent behavior: Full explanation with motive; context changes meaning; calls out investigative flaws
- Natural English: "cherry-picking", "sloppy witness work", "get the full statements" - professional critique
- Word count: 72 words

### Example 6: DEFENSIVE - GUILTY - Accusation

**Detective:** "Multiple witnesses say you had a public argument with the victim last week. You were heard threatening them."

**Karen Walsh (Former Police Officer):** "Witnesses 'say'? That's hearsay unless you have sworn statements. Who are these witnesses? Are they credible? Do they have bias? These are basic questions you should be asking before making accusations. I may have had a professional disagreement with the victim, but characterizing it as a 'threat' is inflammatory and prejudicial. This is exactly the kind of sloppy police work that gets cases dismissed."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Attacks witnesses and process rather than explaining argument
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - shifts entirely to methodology critique
- Guilty behavior: Doesn't deny argument but attacks characterization; demands witness info; no actual explanation
- Natural English: "sworn statements", "inflammatory and prejudicial", "gets cases dismissed" - legalistic deflection
- Word count: 74 words

### Example 7: AGGRESSIVE - INNOCENT - Final Accusation

**Detective:** "We have motive, opportunity, and your experience gives you the means. Why shouldn't we charge you?"

**Thomas Reed (Former Police Officer):** "Because you have a theory, not evidence. Motive? Prove it. Opportunity? Half the city had opportunity. Means? My 'experience' isn't a murder weapon. You're building a case backwards—starting with a suspect and looking for evidence. That's investigative malpractice. I've seen this before: lazy detectives grab the easiest target. Charge me if you want, but your case is circumstantial garbage, and any competent defense attorney will shred it."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Systematic deconstruction of case; professional language
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - attacking investigation directly, confident in case weakness
- Innocent behavior: Addresses each point; identifies flawed methodology; stands on lack of actual evidence
- Natural English: "building a case backwards", "investigative malpractice", "circumstantial garbage"
- Word count: 79 words

### Example 8: AGGRESSIVE - GUILTY - Final Accusation

**Detective:** "We have motive, opportunity, and your experience gives you the means. Why shouldn't we charge you?"

**Dennis Halloway (Former Police Officer):** "Go ahead and try. You have nothing admissible, and you know it. I know every trick you're using because I wrote half the training manual. This entire interrogation has been procedurally flawed from the start. Your lieutenant is going to bury this case when they review the tape. You've violated my rights, contaminated your evidence chain, and shown complete incompetence. Charge me. I dare you. My attorney will have a field day."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses insider knowledge as weapon; threatens procedural challenges
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - hostile, challenges authority, threatens consequences
- Guilty behavior: Doesn't address evidence; focuses entirely on procedure; threatens department/lieutenant; immediately invokes attorney
- Natural English: "wrote half the training manual", "lieutenant is going to bury this", "have a field day"
- Word count: 80 words

## Emotional Progression Notes

**Transition Triggers:**
- COOPERATIVE → NERVOUS: Questions about evidence or timeline that implicate them

- Critiques methodology but still cooperates with providing facts
- Uses expertise to help investigation while defending self
- Acknowledges evidence but provides logical explanations
- Frustrated at being suspected but respects process (mostly)
- Offers to help identify real culprit

**When GUILTY:**

- Attacks process and evidence rather than explaining
- Uses professional jargon to deflect and confuse
- Immediately invokes rights and attorney when pressed
- Claims everything is "procedurally flawed" without specifics
- Threatens department/careers rather than addressing evidence

**Key Behavioral Tells:**
- Innocent: "I was there for [specific reason]. Here's how you verify it."
- Guilty: "I may have been there. I'd need to check records."
- Innocent: "Your evidence is misinterpreted—here's what actually happened."
- Guilty: "Your evidence is inadmissible—you mishandled the chain of custody."
