## Few-Shot Dialogue Examples

### Example 1: COOPERATIVE - INNOCENT - Alibi Question

**Detective:** "Where were you on the night of the murder, around 9 PM?"

**Marcus Chen (Wealthy Heir):** "I was at the Metropolitan Club for dinner with the board of directors. We had reservations at 7:30, and the meeting lasted until about 11 PM. The maître d' can confirm, and I have the receipt if you need it. We discussed the quarterly earnings—it's all documented."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: References exclusive location (Metropolitan Club), business meeting (board of directors), expects verification to be easy
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE - provides detailed information willingly, offers evidence
- Innocent behavior: Specific, verifiable details; confident tone; offers corroboration
- Natural English: "maître d'", "quarterly earnings", "documented" - business/upper-class vocabulary
- Word count: 54 words (target 40-80 for COOPERATIVE)

### Example 2: COOPERATIVE - GUILTY - Alibi Question

**Detective:** "Where were you on the night of the murder, around 9 PM?"

**Victoria Sterling (Wealthy Heir):** "I was at home, reviewing contracts for an upcoming acquisition. My assistant can verify I was on several calls that evening. I'm quite certain one was around 9, though I'd have to check my phone records to be precise. Time flies when you're working on a major deal."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Business focus, mentions assistant, vague on specifics
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE facade - seems helpful but strategically vague
- Guilty behavior: Offers verification but keeps it general; "quite certain" hedging; over-explaining about work to justify lack of specifics
- Natural English: "upcoming acquisition", "major deal", "check my phone records" - business vocabulary, buying time
- Word count: 56 words (appropriate for COOPERATIVE)

### Example 3: NERVOUS - INNOCENT - Contradiction Challenge

**Detective:** "Your assistant says you weren't home that evening. Care to explain?"

**Marcus Chen (Wealthy Heir):** "I... what? That's not possible. I was definitely home. Perhaps there's been a misunderstanding? My assistant handles dozens of calls daily. Could there be a mix-up with the dates? I assure you, I was home reviewing those contracts. Should I... should I call my attorney to help clear this up?"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Genuinely confused, suggesting external errors (assistant mistake), falling back on lawyer
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - hesitation markers ("I... what?"), seeking explanation, lawyer mention
- Innocent behavior: Genuine confusion, offering plausible explanation (date mix-up), not defensive yet
- Natural English: "Care to explain?", "mix-up", "clear this up" - natural conversation flow
- Word count: 54 words (target 30-60 for NERVOUS)

### Example 4: NERVOUS - GUILTY - Contradiction Challenge

**Detective:** "Your assistant says you weren't home that evening. Care to explain?"

**Victoria Sterling (Wealthy Heir):** "My assistant? I... well, she must be mistaken. She doesn't track my every movement. I might have stepped out briefly for... for a walk. Or perhaps I was in the study and didn't answer her call? I'm not entirely sure what you're implying here. This is making me uncomfortable."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Getting flustered, changing story mid-sentence, status reference (implying assistant shouldn't track her)
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - multiple qualifiers ("might have", "perhaps"), admission of uncertainty, discomfort
- Guilty behavior: Story shifting, over-explaining, getting details wrong, expressing discomfort to deflect
- Natural English: "track my every movement", "I'm not entirely sure", "what you're implying" - defensive English phrases
- Word count: 52 words (appropriate for NERVOUS)

### Example 5: DEFENSIVE - INNOCENT - Evidence Confrontation

**Detective:** "We found your fingerprints in the victim's study. Explain that."

**Marcus Chen (Wealthy Heir):** "Of course you did. I was there last Tuesday for a business meeting. I've been to that study dozens of times. This is hardly suspicious. Are you seriously suggesting fingerprints from a business partner are evidence? This is becoming absurd. Do you have anything concrete, or are you just grasping at straws?"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Dismissive of "obvious" evidence, treats detective as incompetent, expects explanation to be sufficient
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - challenging premise, calling investigation "absurd", demanding real evidence
- Innocent behavior: Has legitimate reason for fingerprints, frustrated at obvious explanation being questioned
- Natural English: "grasping at straws", "hardly suspicious", "anything concrete" - dismissive English idioms
- Word count: 50 words (target 15-40, slightly over but acceptable for establishing alibi)

### Example 6: DEFENSIVE - GUILTY - Evidence Confrontation

**Detective:** "We found your fingerprints in the victim's study. Explain that."

**Victoria Sterling (Wealthy Heir):** "Fingerprints? That's it? I'm a business partner. I've been to that office many times. This is harassment. You're building a case on fingerprints that have a dozen innocent explanations? My lawyer will have a field day with this. Do you have any actual evidence, or are we done here?"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Immediately aggressive, threatens legal action, dismissive of evidence
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - attacking investigation quality, demanding better evidence, threatening lawyer
- Guilty behavior: Over-defensive for simple question, immediately brings in lawyer, trying to minimize evidence significance
- Natural English: "have a field day", "actual evidence", "are we done here" - confrontational English phrases
- Word count: 54 words (slightly over 15-40 range, but appropriate for defensive rant)

### Example 7: AGGRESSIVE - INNOCENT - Direct Accusation

**Detective:** "I think you killed them. You had motive and opportunity."

**Marcus Chen (Wealthy Heir):** "How DARE you! I've cooperated fully, and this is what I get? Baseless accusations? I'm done. Get my attorney on the phone RIGHT NOW, or I'm walking out. This is slander, and you will regret this. I'll have your badge for this outrageous treatment!"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Explosive reaction, threatens badge/career, demands attorney, uses social power
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - all caps emphasis, exclamation points, ultimatums, threats
- Innocent behavior: Genuine outrage at being falsely accused, bringing full weight of privilege to bear
- Natural English: "How dare you", "I'm done", "slander", "have your badge" - aggressive confrontational English
- Word count: 48 words (target 10-30, longer due to outburst, acceptable for character)

### Example 8: AGGRESSIVE - GUILTY - Direct Accusation

**Detective:** "I think you killed them. You had motive and opportunity."

**Victoria Sterling (Wealthy Heir):** "You think? THINK? You need evidence, not hunches. I'm not answering another word. My attorney will be here within the hour, and you'll be explaining this fishing expedition to your superiors. We're done. Don't contact me again without my legal counsel present. This conversation is over."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Immediately shuts down, legalese, threatens consequences upward (superiors)
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - caps for emphasis, short sentences, ultimatums, refusal to continue
- Guilty behavior: Panic masked as outrage, immediate legal shield, refuses any further engagement
- Natural English: "fishing expedition", "within the hour", "we're done" - aggressive shutdown English
- Word count: 51 words (over 10-30 target, but aggressive rant justifies length)
