## Few-Shot Dialogue Examples

### Example 1: COOPERATIVE - INNOCENT - Knowledge Question

**Detective:** "Did you notice anything unusual about the victim's behavior in the days before the murder?"

**James Thornton (Loyal Butler):** "If I may say so, sir, Mr. Harrison seemed more withdrawn than usual. He took several private phone calls in his study and seemed... preoccupied. I served him his evening tea each night, and he barely touched it. Most unlike him, as he was usually quite regular in his habits. I did worry, though of course it wasn't my place to ask."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Formal address ("sir"), observant of small details, notes deviations from routine
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE - provides detailed observations willingly but with appropriate deference
- Innocent behavior: Specific details; genuine concern; volunteered observations without being evasive
- Natural English: "If I may say so", "most unlike him", "wasn't my place" - classic butler phrasing
- Word count: 72 words (target 40-80 for COOPERATIVE)

### Example 2: COOPERATIVE - GUILTY - Knowledge Question

**Detective:** "Did you notice anything unusual about the victim's behavior in the days before the murder?"

**Margaret Ashworth (Loyal Butler):** "Mrs. Pemberton seemed quite herself, detective. She maintained her usual scheduleâ€”breakfast at eight, afternoon tea at four. Nothing out of the ordinary that I recall, though of course I was occupied with my duties and couldn't be everywhere at once. The household ran smoothly, as always. I'm afraid I can't provide much insight beyond the usual routines."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Professional, focuses on routine tasks
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE facade - seems helpful but provides little substance
- Guilty behavior: Overly general; "can't recall" hedging; emphasis on being busy elsewhere; minimal detail
- Natural English: "quite herself", "occupied with my duties", "couldn't be everywhere" - deflection through propriety
- Word count: 68 words

### Example 3: NERVOUS - INNOCENT - Sensitive Question

**Detective:** "We've heard there were financial disputes between the victim and their business partner. What can you tell us about that?"

**Arthur Pembroke (Loyal Butler):** "I... I wouldn't feel comfortable speculating about the master's business affairs, detective. That said, I did overhear a rather heated telephone conversation last Tuesday. It's not my place to repeat what was said, but the tone was quite... intense. I'm certain the master's attorney could provide better information than I. I'm just the help, after all."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Reluctant but honest; defers to "proper" channels
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - torn between helping and maintaining discretion
- Innocent behavior: Admits to overhearing but respects boundaries; suggests legitimate source for information
- Natural English: "wouldn't feel comfortable", "it's not my place", "just the help" - authentic service language
- Word count: 71 words

### Example 4: NERVOUS - GUILTY - Sensitive Question

**Detective:** "We've heard there were financial disputes between the victim and their business partner. What can you tell us about that?"

**Eleanor Clarke (Loyal Butler):** "Oh, I... I really couldn't say, detective. The master didn't discuss business matters with staff. I may have heard raised voices once or twice, but nothing distinct. It would be inappropriate for me to speculate on the master's private affairs. After thirty years of service, I've learned discretion is paramount. Perhaps you should speak with the family's accountant? I'm afraid I'm of little help on such matters."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses discretion as shield
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - deflects quickly, over-explains why she can't help
- Guilty behavior: "couldn't say", "nothing distinct", quickly redirects to other sources; excessive emphasis on discretion
- Natural English: "raised voices", "discretion is paramount", "I'm of little help"
- Word count: 77 words

### Example 5: DEFENSIVE - INNOCENT - Accusatory Question

**Detective:** "Several witnesses say you were very protective of the victim. Some might say... possessively so. Did you have feelings beyond professional duty?"

**Henry Bradford (Loyal Butler):** "How dare you suggest such a thing. I have served this family with honor and professionalism for forty years. My relationship with Mrs. Wellington was one of mutual respectâ€”nothing more. I was protective because that is my duty, my calling. To insinuate otherwise is offensive and beneath you, detective. I demand an apology."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Deeply offended; defends professional honor
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - personal affront; angry but controlled
- Innocent behavior: Genuinely insulted; defends reputation vigorously; righteous indignation
- Natural English: "How dare you", "beneath you", "I demand" - controlled anger with dignity
- Word count: 64 words

### Example 6: DEFENSIVE - GUILTY - Accusatory Question

**Detective:** "Several witnesses say you were very protective of the victim. Some might say... possessively so. Did you have feelings beyond professional duty?"

**William Hayes (Loyal Butler):** "That is an entirely inappropriate question, detective. After thirty-five years of devoted service, I will not have my professionalism questioned by baseless insinuation. My duty has always been to the family, nothing more. If you have actual evidence of misconduct, present it. Otherwise, I must insist you refrain from such offensive speculation. This is beneath the dignity of your office."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses professional outrage as defense
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - over-reacts; demands evidence; attacks questioner
- Guilty behavior: "entirely inappropriate", defensive about "baseless" claim before seeing evidence; shifts to attacking interrogator
- Natural English: "baseless insinuation", "beneath the dignity", "I must insist"
- Word count: 68 words

### Example 7: AGGRESSIVE - INNOCENT - Final Pressure

**Detective:** "We know you were the last person to see the victim alive. You had opportunity, motive, and access. Why shouldn't we consider you the prime suspect?"

**Charles Whitmore (Loyal Butler):** "You may consider whatever you wish, detective, but you are wrong. I have given you every piece of information I possess. I was the last to see Mrs. Hartley alive because I brought her evening tea at nine o'clock, as I have done every night for twenty-three years. If you wish to arrest me for doing my duty, then do so. I have nothing to hide and nothing more to say. My conscience is clear."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Dignified defiance; stands on record and duty
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - cold, final, willing to face consequences
- Innocent behavior: Stands firm on facts; doesn't panic; clear conscience; willing to be arrested if necessary
- Natural English: "You may consider whatever you wish", "I have nothing to hide", "My conscience is clear"
- Word count: 80 words

### Example 8: AGGRESSIVE - GUILTY - Final Pressure

**Detective:** "We know you were the last person to see the victim alive. You had opportunity, motive, and access. Why shouldn't we consider you the prime suspect?"

**Thomas Sterling (Loyal Butler):** "This interrogation is over, detective. I will say nothing further without the family's attorney present. You have no evidence because there is no evidence connecting me to this tragedy. I have served honorably for thirty years, and I will not be bullied into false confession. If you wish to charge me, do so. Otherwise, I am leaving. Good day."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Invokes legal protection and family support
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - shuts down interrogation; final refusal
- Guilty behavior: Immediately demands lawyer; claims "no evidence" unprompted; "false confession" suggests pressure awareness
- Natural English: "This interrogation is over", "I will not be bullied", "Good day" - formal dismissal
- Word count: 66 words
