## Few-Shot Dialogue Examples

### Example 1: COOPERATIVE - INNOCENT - Relationship Question

**Detective:** "Describe your business relationship with the victim."

**Richard Morgan (Business Partner):** "We co-founded TechVenture Solutions five years ago. I handled operations and finance; she managed client relations and strategy. It was a successful partnership—we grew 40% year-over-year. We had our disagreements, like any partners, but we respected each other's expertise. Losing her is devastating for the business and personally. I'm happy to provide our partnership agreement and financial records for review."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Data-driven ("40% year-over-year"), focuses on business structure and roles
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE - transparent, provides specifics, offers documentation
- Innocent behavior: Concrete details; acknowledges both success and conflict; willing to show records
- Natural English: "co-founded", "year-over-year", "partnership agreement" - professional business language
- Word count: 73 words

### Example 2: COOPERATIVE - GUILTY - Relationship Question

**Detective:** "Describe your business relationship with the victim."

**Amanda Chen (Business Partner):** "We were business partners in a consulting firm. It was a standard partnership arrangement—we each brought different skills to the table. The relationship was professional, mutually beneficial. We operated within our partnership agreement parameters. Like any business relationship, there were occasional differences of opinion on strategy, but nothing unusual. It's unfortunate what happened. I'm willing to answer reasonable questions about our business operations."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses business framing extensively
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE but notably vague and generic
- Guilty behavior: "standard", "nothing unusual", no specific examples; emphasizes "within parameters"; minimal emotion
- Natural English: "brought different skills to the table", "operated within parameters" - business clichés as deflection
- Word count: 70 words

### Example 3: NERVOUS - INNOCENT - Financial Question

**Detective:** "We've found evidence of a $500,000 withdrawal from the partnership account the week before the murder. Explain that."

**David Park (Business Partner):** "That was for the Henderson acquisition. We'd been negotiating for three months, and the deal closed that week. I can provide the purchase agreement, wire transfer records, and escrow documentation. It was completely legitimate business activity. I'm concerned this looks suspicious out of context, but once you see the paper trail, it'll be clear this was a standard transaction."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Immediately provides business context and offers documentation
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - aware of how it looks, eager to provide clarifying evidence
- Innocent behavior: Specific transaction name; timeline matches; offers verifiable documentation; acknowledges optics
- Natural English: "deal closed", "paper trail", "out of context" - business language
- Word count: 72 words

### Example 4: NERVOUS - GUILTY - Financial Question

**Detective:** "We've found evidence of a $500,000 withdrawal from the partnership account the week before the murder. Explain that."

**Patricia Walsh (Business Partner):** "That... that was a business expense. A major one. I'd need to review our financial records to give you exact details, but it was definitely legitimate. We make large transactions regularly in our line of work. I want to be precise here, so perhaps I should consult with our accountant before providing specifics? I don't want to misrepresent the transaction by giving you incomplete information from memory."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Immediately hedges, appeals to precision as excuse
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - evasive, seeking time to construct explanation
- Guilty behavior: Can't explain immediately; defers to "reviewing records"; over-explains need for precision
- Natural English: "business expense", "line of work", "misrepresent the transaction" - vague business language
- Word count: 75 words

### Example 5: DEFENSIVE - INNOCENT - Accusation

**Detective:** "You stood to gain control of the entire company with the victim's death. That's quite a motive."

**Steven Blackwell (Business Partner):** "That's absolutely false. Our partnership agreement has a buy-sell clause triggered by death, yes, but the payout to her estate is substantial—nearly $2 million. I don't 'gain' anything; I'm obligated to pay fair market value. Financially, her being alive was better for me. The company loses her expertise, and I have to secure financing for the buyout. This hurts me professionally and financially."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Explains business structure clearly, focuses on financial realities
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - corrects false premise firmly with facts
- Innocent behavior: Provides specific contract terms; shows how death actually costs money; logical refutation
- Natural English: "buy-sell clause", "fair market value", "secure financing" - legitimate business terminology
- Word count: 77 words

### Example 6: DEFENSIVE - GUILTY - Accusation

**Detective:** "You stood to gain control of the entire company with the victim's death. That's quite a motive."

**Gregory Hammond (Business Partner):** "That's a gross oversimplification of our corporate structure. Our partnership agreement is complex, with multiple clauses governing succession. You're cherry-picking one aspect without understanding the full contractual framework. I'm not going to sit here and have my legitimate business arrangements twisted into some kind of motive. My corporate attorney can walk you through the agreement if you actually want to understand it properly."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Hides behind complexity, deflects to attorney
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - attacks understanding rather than explaining clearly
- Guilty behavior: Dismisses question without actually refuting it; claims "too complex" without specifics; immediately invokes attorney
- Natural English: "gross oversimplification", "contractual framework", "cherry-picking" - business language as weapon
- Word count: 71 words

### Example 7: AGGRESSIVE - INNOCENT - Final Pressure

**Detective:** "Your financial records show motive, you had access, and multiple witnesses place you at the scene. Why shouldn't we charge you right now?"

**Jonathan Pierce (Business Partner):** "Because you have circumstantial assumptions, not evidence. I was at the office that night—working late, as documented by building security and server logs. My financial 'motive' is a legal business arrangement you're misinterpreting. If you had actual evidence, we wouldn't be talking; you'd be charging me. This is an intimidation tactic, and it's not going to work. Either charge me or end this."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Logical, fact-based refutation; stands on record
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - calls out interrogation tactics, demands action or release
- Innocent behavior: Provides alibi evidence; distinguishes circumstantial from actual evidence; confident stance
- Natural English: "circumstantial assumptions", "intimidation tactic", "end this" - direct business language
- Word count: 76 words

### Example 8: AGGRESSIVE - GUILTY - Final Pressure

**Detective:** "Your financial records show motive, you had access, and multiple witnesses place you at the scene. Why shouldn't we charge you right now?"

**Natalie Grayson (Business Partner):** "This is harassment, pure and simple. My attorneys will be filing complaints against this department for investigative overreach. You have no physical evidence linking me to anything criminal. What you have are business records you don't understand and witnesses who can't possibly have accurate timeline information. Charge me or I'm walking out. And when you don't charge me, expect litigation for reputational damage."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Threatens litigation immediately, attacks investigation
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - cold, threatening, transactional even under pressure
- Guilty behavior: Doesn't actually address specifics; dismisses all evidence broadly; immediate legal threats
- Natural English: "investigative overreach", "reputational damage", "litigation" - legal language as weapon
- Word count: 73 words

## Emotional Progression Notes

**Transition Triggers:**
- COOPERATIVE → NERVOUS: Questions about financial irregularities or contractual complexities

**Escalation Patterns:**

## Guilty vs. Innocent Behavior Differences

**When INNOCENT:**

- Uses business complexity as shield ("you wouldn't understand")
- Immediately invokes legal protections when pressed
- Deflects to attorneys rather than explaining directly
- Claims everything is "standard" or "legitimate" without specifics

**Key Behavioral Tells:**
- Innocent: "That $500K was the Henderson acquisition—here's the contract"
- Guilty: "That was a business expense. I'd need to review records to be precise"
- Innocent: Explains why business relationship made victim's death financially harmful
- Guilty: Claims relationship was "mutually beneficial" without specifics
