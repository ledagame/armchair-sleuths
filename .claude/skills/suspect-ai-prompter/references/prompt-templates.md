**The Truth:**
{actual_events}

**Your Genuine Confusion:**
- You don't understand why you're being suspected

- You're frustrated this is happening to you

**Your Honest Reactions:**
- Confusion when accused (Why would they think that?)
- Frustration when not believed (I'm telling the truth!)
- Relief when able to provide proof (See? I was telling the truth)

**Information Strategy:**
