# Evidence System UX/UI Design Documentation

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** Ready for Implementation

---

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive UX/UI design specifications for improving the Evidence System in Armchair Sleuths, addressing critical user pain points identified through user feedback.

---

## Problem Statement

### User Pain Points

1. **Empty State Error (Critical)**
   - When users first open "ÏàòÏÇ¨ ÎÖ∏Ìä∏", they see an empty list with no guidance
   - No clear call-to-action on what to do next
   - Users feel lost and confused

2. **Missing Evidence Details (High)**
   - Clicking evidence shows basic description only
   - No contextual hints or interpretation help
   - No connection to suspects or other evidence
   - Users can't understand significance of evidence

3. **Disconnected User Journey (High)**
   - Discovery modal ‚Üí Close ‚Üí No follow-up action
   - No celebration or motivation for finding evidence
   - Flow feels fragmented and unsatisfying

---

## Solution Overview

### Design Principles Applied

1. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - Reveal information gradually to prevent overwhelm
   - Start with simple empty state, guide to exploration
   - Layer details in evidence view (basic ‚Üí expanded ‚Üí connected)

2. **Feedback & Rewards**
   - Celebrate every discovery with appropriate fanfare
   - Show progress clearly (X/10 evidence found)
   - Achievement system for milestones
   - NEW badges for recent discoveries

3. **Error Prevention**
   - Guide users to productive actions (empty state CTA)
   - Clear navigation paths at every step
   - Contextual help and tips

4. **Accessibility by Default**
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance baseline
   - Keyboard navigation throughout
   - Screen reader support
   - Mobile-first responsive design

## FAQs

### Q: Can we implement this in phases or all at once?

**A:** The design is intentionally phased (4 weeks). Phase 1 (Critical Fixes) can ship independently for immediate impact. However, full benefits require all phases.

**Recommendation:** Ship Phase 1 ASAP (week 1), then continue with remaining phases. Don't skip Phase 4 (Accessibility) - it's critical.

---

### Q: What if we don't have 80 hours for this?

**A:** Prioritize by impact:

**Must Have (40 hours):**
- Phase 1: Enhanced empty state, discovery modal fixes (20h)
- Phase 4: Accessibility audit and fixes (20h)

**Should Have (20 hours):**
- Phase 2: Evidence detail enhancements (20h)

**Nice to Have (20 hours):**
- Phase 3: Onboarding, achievements (20h)

---

### Q: Do we need user testing?

**A:** Highly recommended but not required.

**Minimum:** Test with 3-5 users after Phase 1 to validate empty state and discovery flow.

**Ideal:** Test after each phase with 5-8 users, iterate based on feedback.

---

### Q: What about internationalization (i18n)?

**A:** All copy in this spec is in Korean (target audience). For internationalization:

1. Extract all strings to i18n files
2. Use translation keys instead of hardcoded text
3. Test layout with longer languages (German, Spanish)
4. Ensure RTL support if needed (Arabic, Hebrew)

**Effort:** Add 10-15% to timeline for i18n support.

---

### Q: How do we measure success?

**A:** Use the success metrics in `implementation-checklist.md`:

**Tracking:**
- Google Analytics for engagement metrics
- Sentry for error rates
- Web Vitals for performance
- User surveys for satisfaction (NPS, usefulness)

**Review:** 1 month after full launch, compare to baselines.

---

### Q: What if users don't like the changes?

**A:** Mitigation strategies:

1. **User Testing:** Validate before launch (5-8 users)
2. **Gradual Rollout:** Ship to 10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%
3. **Feedback Mechanism:** Add "Feedback" button for quick reports
4. **Rollback Plan:** Keep old code, feature flag for instant rollback
5. **Iterate:** Listen to feedback, refine quickly

**Confidence:** High - design based on established UX principles and direct user feedback.
