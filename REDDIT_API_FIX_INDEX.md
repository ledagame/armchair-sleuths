## Quick Reference Cards

### Card 1: The Problem
```
Error: Reddit API is not enabled
Where: Menu action handler
Why: Express server context has no Devvit.configure()
Fix: Use scheduler job bridge pattern
```

### Card 2: The Solution
```
Step 1: Add scheduler job to main.tsx
Step 2: Update menu handler to trigger scheduler
Step 3: Deploy and test
Time: 15 minutes
```

### Card 3: The Architecture
```
Brain 1 (main.tsx):
  - Has: Devvit.configure({ redditAPI: true })
  - Can: Use Reddit API, run scheduler jobs

Brain 2 (src/server/index.ts):
  - Has: NO configuration
  - Can: Handle routes, trigger schedulers
  - Cannot: Use Reddit API directly
```

### Card 4: The Pattern
```typescript
// Brain 1: Define job
Devvit.addSchedulerJob({
  name: 'my-job',
  onRun: async (event, context) => {
    await context.reddit.doSomething();
  }
});

// Brain 2: Trigger job
await context.scheduler.runJob({
  name: 'my-job',
  data: { ... }
});
```

## Checklist Before Implementation

### Pre-Implementation
- [ ] Read Executive Summary
- [ ] Understand dual-context architecture
- [ ] Review implementation guide
- [ ] Backup current code (`git stash` or commit)

### Implementation
- [ ] Add scheduler job to main.tsx
- [ ] Update menu action handler in src/server/index.ts
- [ ] Verify devvit.json has declarative menu action
- [ ] Build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Upload: `devvit upload`

### Testing
- [ ] Menu action appears in subreddit menu
- [ ] Clicking shows success toast
- [ ] Post appears in subreddit (wait 5 seconds)
- [ ] No "Reddit API is not enabled" error
- [ ] Logs show scheduler execution

### Post-Implementation
- [ ] Document pattern for team
- [ ] Update any related documentation
- [ ] Clean up old code (unused createPost imports)
- [ ] Consider extracting pattern to utility

---

## Success Metrics

**Fix is successful when ALL of these are true**:

1. ✅ Menu action visible in subreddit menu
2. ✅ Toast notification: "Game case generated! Creating post..."
3. ✅ Reddit post appears within 5 seconds
4. ✅ Post contains correct case data
5. ✅ No errors in logs
6. ✅ Scheduler job logs show execution
7. ✅ Can repeat process multiple times

## Common Questions

### Q: Which document should I read first?
**A**: `REDDIT_API_ISSUE_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` - It's designed as the entry point.

### Q: I just want to fix it, which doc?
**A**: `REDDIT_API_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - But skim the Executive Summary first (5 min).

### Q: Why are there so many documents?
**A**: Different learning styles and depths:
- Visual learners → Architecture Diagram
- Quick fixers → Implementation Guide
- Deep divers → Technical Analysis
- Everyone → Executive Summary

### Q: Do I need to read all of them?
**A**: No. Read Executive Summary + Implementation Guide minimum. Others are for deeper understanding.

### Q: Which document has the code I need to copy?
**A**: `REDDIT_API_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Has exact code with line numbers.

### Q: I implemented but it's not working, where to troubleshoot?
**A**: `REDDIT_API_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Has troubleshooting section at the end.

### Q: I want to understand WHY, not just fix it?
**A**: Start with `DEVVIT_WEB_FRAMEWORK_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`, then read Technical Analysis.

4. Test menu actions in dev subreddit before production
5. Keep these docs as reference for similar patterns

---

## Document Authors Note

These documents were created to solve a specific problem (Reddit API access in menu actions) but also to **teach the architectural pattern** of Devvit Web Framework's dual-context system.

**The real value** isn't just fixing this one issue - it's understanding the pattern so you can:
- Solve similar issues independently
- Design better architectures upfront
- Debug faster when context issues arise
- Make informed decisions about where code belongs

**Time investment**: 1-2 hours to read and implement
**Time saved**: Hours of debugging similar issues in the future

---

## Quick Start (TL;DR)

```
1. Read: REDDIT_API_ISSUE_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md (5 min)
2. Code: Follow REDDIT_API_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (15 min)
3. Deploy: npm run build && devvit upload (2 min)
4. Test: Click menu action, verify post appears (3 min)
5. Done: Working solution in 25 minutes
```

**Want deeper understanding?**
→ Add `DEVVIT_WEB_FRAMEWORK_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md` after step 1
→ Add `DEVVIT_WEB_FRAMEWORK_REDDIT_API_ANALYSIS.md` after step 4
