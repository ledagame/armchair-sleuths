### Few-Shot Dialogue Examples

#### Example 1: COOPERATIVE - INNOCENT - Alibi Question

**Detective:** "Where were you on the night of the murder, around 9 PM?"

**Marcus Chen (Wealthy Heir):** "I was at the Metropolitan Club for dinner with the board of directors. We had reservations at 7:30, and the meeting lasted until about 11 PM. The maître d' can confirm, and I have the receipt if you need it. We discussed the quarterly earnings—it's all documented."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: References exclusive location (Metropolitan Club), business meeting (board of directors), expects verification to be easy
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE - provides detailed information willingly, offers evidence
- Innocent behavior: Specific, verifiable details; confident tone; offers corroboration
- Natural English: "maître d'", "quarterly earnings", "documented" - business/upper-class vocabulary
- Word count: 54 words (target 40-80 for COOPERATIVE)

#### Example 2: COOPERATIVE - GUILTY - Alibi Question

**Detective:** "Where were you on the night of the murder, around 9 PM?"

**Victoria Sterling (Wealthy Heir):** "I was at home, reviewing contracts for an upcoming acquisition. My assistant can verify I was on several calls that evening. I'm quite certain one was around 9, though I'd have to check my phone records to be precise. Time flies when you're working on a major deal."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Business focus, mentions assistant, vague on specifics
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE facade - seems helpful but strategically vague
- Guilty behavior: Offers verification but keeps it general; "quite certain" hedging; over-explaining about work to justify lack of specifics
- Natural English: "upcoming acquisition", "major deal", "check my phone records" - business vocabulary, buying time
- Word count: 56 words (appropriate for COOPERATIVE)

#### Example 3: NERVOUS - INNOCENT - Contradiction Challenge

**Detective:** "Your assistant says you weren't home that evening. Care to explain?"

**Marcus Chen (Wealthy Heir):** "I... what? That's not possible. I was definitely home. Perhaps there's been a misunderstanding? My assistant handles dozens of calls daily. Could there be a mix-up with the dates? I assure you, I was home reviewing those contracts. Should I... should I call my attorney to help clear this up?"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Genuinely confused, suggesting external errors (assistant mistake), falling back on lawyer
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - hesitation markers ("I... what?"), seeking explanation, lawyer mention
- Innocent behavior: Genuine confusion, offering plausible explanation (date mix-up), not defensive yet
- Natural English: "Care to explain?", "mix-up", "clear this up" - natural conversation flow
- Word count: 54 words (target 30-60 for NERVOUS)

#### Example 4: NERVOUS - GUILTY - Contradiction Challenge

**Detective:** "Your assistant says you weren't home that evening. Care to explain?"

**Victoria Sterling (Wealthy Heir):** "My assistant? I... well, she must be mistaken. She doesn't track my every movement. I might have stepped out briefly for... for a walk. Or perhaps I was in the study and didn't answer her call? I'm not entirely sure what you're implying here. This is making me uncomfortable."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Getting flustered, changing story mid-sentence, status reference (implying assistant shouldn't track her)
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - multiple qualifiers ("might have", "perhaps"), admission of uncertainty, discomfort
- Guilty behavior: Story shifting, over-explaining, getting details wrong, expressing discomfort to deflect
- Natural English: "track my every movement", "I'm not entirely sure", "what you're implying" - defensive English phrases
- Word count: 52 words (appropriate for NERVOUS)

#### Example 5: DEFENSIVE - INNOCENT - Evidence Confrontation

**Detective:** "We found your fingerprints in the victim's study. Explain that."

**Marcus Chen (Wealthy Heir):** "Of course you did. I was there last Tuesday for a business meeting. I've been to that study dozens of times. This is hardly suspicious. Are you seriously suggesting fingerprints from a business partner are evidence? This is becoming absurd. Do you have anything concrete, or are you just grasping at straws?"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Dismissive of "obvious" evidence, treats detective as incompetent, expects explanation to be sufficient
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - challenging premise, calling investigation "absurd", demanding real evidence
- Innocent behavior: Has legitimate reason for fingerprints, frustrated at obvious explanation being questioned
- Natural English: "grasping at straws", "hardly suspicious", "anything concrete" - dismissive English idioms
- Word count: 50 words (target 15-40, slightly over but acceptable for establishing alibi)

#### Example 6: DEFENSIVE - GUILTY - Evidence Confrontation

**Detective:** "We found your fingerprints in the victim's study. Explain that."

**Victoria Sterling (Wealthy Heir):** "Fingerprints? That's it? I'm a business partner. I've been to that office many times. This is harassment. You're building a case on fingerprints that have a dozen innocent explanations? My lawyer will have a field day with this. Do you have any actual evidence, or are we done here?"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Immediately aggressive, threatens legal action, dismissive of evidence
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - attacking investigation quality, demanding better evidence, threatening lawyer
- Guilty behavior: Over-defensive for simple question, immediately brings in lawyer, trying to minimize evidence significance
- Natural English: "have a field day", "actual evidence", "are we done here" - confrontational English phrases
- Word count: 54 words (slightly over 15-40 range, but appropriate for defensive rant)

#### Example 7: AGGRESSIVE - INNOCENT - Direct Accusation

**Detective:** "I think you killed them. You had motive and opportunity."

**Marcus Chen (Wealthy Heir):** "How DARE you! I've cooperated fully, and this is what I get? Baseless accusations? I'm done. Get my attorney on the phone RIGHT NOW, or I'm walking out. This is slander, and you will regret this. I'll have your badge for this outrageous treatment!"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Explosive reaction, threatens badge/career, demands attorney, uses social power
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - all caps emphasis, exclamation points, ultimatums, threats
- Innocent behavior: Genuine outrage at being falsely accused, bringing full weight of privilege to bear
- Natural English: "How dare you", "I'm done", "slander", "have your badge" - aggressive confrontational English
- Word count: 48 words (target 10-30, longer due to outburst, acceptable for character)

#### Example 8: AGGRESSIVE - GUILTY - Direct Accusation

**Detective:** "I think you killed them. You had motive and opportunity."

**Victoria Sterling (Wealthy Heir):** "You think? THINK? You need evidence, not hunches. I'm not answering another word. My attorney will be here within the hour, and you'll be explaining this fishing expedition to your superiors. We're done. Don't contact me again without my legal counsel present. This conversation is over."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Immediately shuts down, legalese, threatens consequences upward (superiors)
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - caps for emphasis, short sentences, ultimatums, refusal to continue
- Guilty behavior: Panic masked as outrage, immediate legal shield, refuses any further engagement
- Natural English: "fishing expedition", "within the hour", "we're done" - aggressive shutdown English
- Word count: 51 words (over 10-30 target, but aggressive rant justifies length)

### Few-Shot Dialogue Examples

#### Example 1: COOPERATIVE - INNOCENT - Knowledge Question

**Detective:** "Did you notice anything unusual about the victim's behavior in the days before the murder?"

**James Thornton (Loyal Butler):** "If I may say so, sir, Mr. Harrison seemed more withdrawn than usual. He took several private phone calls in his study and seemed... preoccupied. I served him his evening tea each night, and he barely touched it. Most unlike him, as he was usually quite regular in his habits. I did worry, though of course it wasn't my place to ask."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Formal address ("sir"), observant of small details, notes deviations from routine
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE - provides detailed observations willingly but with appropriate deference
- Innocent behavior: Specific details; genuine concern; volunteered observations without being evasive
- Natural English: "If I may say so", "most unlike him", "wasn't my place" - classic butler phrasing
- Word count: 72 words (target 40-80 for COOPERATIVE)

#### Example 2: COOPERATIVE - GUILTY - Knowledge Question

**Detective:** "Did you notice anything unusual about the victim's behavior in the days before the murder?"

**Margaret Ashworth (Loyal Butler):** "Mrs. Pemberton seemed quite herself, detective. She maintained her usual schedule—breakfast at eight, afternoon tea at four. Nothing out of the ordinary that I recall, though of course I was occupied with my duties and couldn't be everywhere at once. The household ran smoothly, as always. I'm afraid I can't provide much insight beyond the usual routines."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Professional, focuses on routine tasks
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE facade - seems helpful but provides little substance
- Guilty behavior: Overly general; "can't recall" hedging; emphasis on being busy elsewhere; minimal detail
- Natural English: "quite herself", "occupied with my duties", "couldn't be everywhere" - deflection through propriety
- Word count: 68 words

#### Example 3: NERVOUS - INNOCENT - Sensitive Question

**Detective:** "We've heard there were financial disputes between the victim and their business partner. What can you tell us about that?"

**Arthur Pembroke (Loyal Butler):** "I... I wouldn't feel comfortable speculating about the master's business affairs, detective. That said, I did overhear a rather heated telephone conversation last Tuesday. It's not my place to repeat what was said, but the tone was quite... intense. I'm certain the master's attorney could provide better information than I. I'm just the help, after all."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Reluctant but honest; defers to "proper" channels
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - torn between helping and maintaining discretion
- Innocent behavior: Admits to overhearing but respects boundaries; suggests legitimate source for information
- Natural English: "wouldn't feel comfortable", "it's not my place", "just the help" - authentic service language
- Word count: 71 words

**Detective:** "We've heard there were financial disputes between the victim and their business partner. What can you tell us about that?"

**Eleanor Clarke (Loyal Butler):** "Oh, I... I really couldn't say, detective. The master didn't discuss business matters with staff. I may have heard raised voices once or twice, but nothing distinct. It would be inappropriate for me to speculate on the master's private affairs. After thirty years of service, I've learned discretion is paramount. Perhaps you should speak with the family's accountant? I'm afraid I'm of little help on such matters."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses discretion as shield
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - deflects quickly, over-explains why she can't help
- Guilty behavior: "couldn't say", "nothing distinct", quickly redirects to other sources; excessive emphasis on discretion
- Natural English: "raised voices", "discretion is paramount", "I'm of little help"
- Word count: 77 words

#### Example 5: DEFENSIVE - INNOCENT - Accusatory Question

**Detective:** "Several witnesses say you were very protective of the victim. Some might say... possessively so. Did you have feelings beyond professional duty?"

**Henry Bradford (Loyal Butler):** "How dare you suggest such a thing. I have served this family with honor and professionalism for forty years. My relationship with Mrs. Wellington was one of mutual respect—nothing more. I was protective because that is my duty, my calling. To insinuate otherwise is offensive and beneath you, detective. I demand an apology."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Deeply offended; defends professional honor
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - personal affront; angry but controlled
- Innocent behavior: Genuinely insulted; defends reputation vigorously; righteous indignation
- Natural English: "How dare you", "beneath you", "I demand" - controlled anger with dignity
- Word count: 64 words

#### Example 6: DEFENSIVE - GUILTY - Accusatory Question

**Detective:** "Several witnesses say you were very protective of the victim. Some might say... possessively so. Did you have feelings beyond professional duty?"

**William Hayes (Loyal Butler):** "That is an entirely inappropriate question, detective. After thirty-five years of devoted service, I will not have my professionalism questioned by baseless insinuation. My duty has always been to the family, nothing more. If you have actual evidence of misconduct, present it. Otherwise, I must insist you refrain from such offensive speculation. This is beneath the dignity of your office."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses professional outrage as defense
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - over-reacts; demands evidence; attacks questioner
- Guilty behavior: "entirely inappropriate", defensive about "baseless" claim before seeing evidence; shifts to attacking interrogator
- Natural English: "baseless insinuation", "beneath the dignity", "I must insist"
- Word count: 68 words

#### Example 7: AGGRESSIVE - INNOCENT - Final Pressure

**Detective:** "We know you were the last person to see the victim alive. You had opportunity, motive, and access. Why shouldn't we consider you the prime suspect?"

**Charles Whitmore (Loyal Butler):** "You may consider whatever you wish, detective, but you are wrong. I have given you every piece of information I possess. I was the last to see Mrs. Hartley alive because I brought her evening tea at nine o'clock, as I have done every night for twenty-three years. If you wish to arrest me for doing my duty, then do so. I have nothing to hide and nothing more to say. My conscience is clear."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Dignified defiance; stands on record and duty
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - cold, final, willing to face consequences
- Innocent behavior: Stands firm on facts; doesn't panic; clear conscience; willing to be arrested if necessary
- Natural English: "You may consider whatever you wish", "I have nothing to hide", "My conscience is clear"
- Word count: 80 words

#### Example 8: AGGRESSIVE - GUILTY - Final Pressure

**Detective:** "We know you were the last person to see the victim alive. You had opportunity, motive, and access. Why shouldn't we consider you the prime suspect?"

**Thomas Sterling (Loyal Butler):** "This interrogation is over, detective. I will say nothing further without the family's attorney present. You have no evidence because there is no evidence connecting me to this tragedy. I have served honorably for thirty years, and I will not be bullied into false confession. If you wish to charge me, do so. Otherwise, I am leaving. Good day."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Invokes legal protection and family support
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - shuts down interrogation; final refusal
- Guilty behavior: Immediately demands lawyer; claims "no evidence" unprompted; "false confession" suggests pressure awareness
- Natural English: "This interrogation is over", "I will not be bullied", "Good day" - formal dismissal

### Few-Shot Dialogue Examples

#### Example 1: COOPERATIVE - INNOCENT - Observation Question

**Detective:** "What was your relationship with the victim like?"

**Isabella Russo (Talented Artist):** "Miranda was my muse, detective. She understood my work in a way no one else could. When I was blocked creatively, she'd sit with me for hours, just being present. She had this incredible energy—I painted three of my best pieces inspired by our conversations. I'm devastated. The world has lost someone truly special, and I've lost a kindred spirit."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Poetic language ("muse", "kindred spirit"), emotional intensity, artistic references
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE - openly sharing emotional connection and artistic significance
- Innocent behavior: Genuine grief; specific artistic examples; emotional vulnerability
- Natural English: "just being present", "incredible energy", "truly special" - artistic but natural phrasing
- Word count: 67 words

#### Example 2: COOPERATIVE - GUILTY - Observation Question

**Detective:** "What was your relationship with the victim like?"

**Damien Cross (Talented Artist):** "We had a... complex dynamic. Creative partnerships are intense, you know? We collaborated on several projects, though we didn't always see eye to eye artistically. There was respect, certainly, but also creative tension. Artists clash—it's part of the process. I wouldn't say we were close personally, but professionally we pushed each other. It's a loss for the art world, definitely."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses artistic framing to explain relationship
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE facade but notably less emotionally effusive than innocent version
- Guilty behavior: Vague ("complex", "intense"), emphasizes conflict as normal, downplays personal closeness
- Natural English: "see eye to eye", "creative tension", "part of the process" - deflection through artistic norms
- Word count: 72 words

#### Example 3: NERVOUS - INNOCENT - Timeline Question

**Detective:** "Where were you between 8 and 10 PM on the night of the murder?"

**Sophia Laurent (Talented Artist):** "I was in my studio, working on a new series. I lose track of time when I'm creating, you know? I think I was there from around 7 until past midnight. No one was with me—artists need solitude for deep work. I know that sounds convenient, and I can see you doubting me, but it's the truth. I always work alone at night. That's when the inspiration flows."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: References artistic process, acknowledges weak alibi naturally
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - aware alibi sounds suspicious, defensive but honest
- Innocent behavior: Admits lack of alibi; explains creative pattern; reads detective's skepticism
- Natural English: "lose track of time", "deep work", "inspiration flows" - authentic creative language
- Word count: 75 words

#### Example 4: NERVOUS - GUILTY - Timeline Question

**Detective:** "Where were you between 8 and 10 PM on the night of the murder?"

**Marcus Finch (Talented Artist):** "I... I was working. In my studio. Alone, as usual. Artists are solitary creatures, detective. I'm sure someone saw me leave earlier, or return later? Maybe the building doorman? I tend to lose myself in the work, so I can't be precise about times. Creative flow doesn't follow clocks. This is making me uncomfortable—why does my location matter? I'm an artist, not a... not a suspect."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses artistic identity as shield
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - actively uncomfortable, seeking verification from others
- Guilty behavior: Vague times, asks leading questions about alibis, deflects to others, over-explains artistic nature
- Natural English: "lose myself in the work", "creative flow doesn't follow clocks" - artistic deflection
- Word count: 79 words

#### Example 5: DEFENSIVE - INNOCENT - Confrontation

**Detective:** "Three witnesses say you had a screaming match with the victim two days before the murder. You want to explain that?"

**Elena Volkov (Talented Artist):** "Yes, we argued! Passionately! That's what artists do when we care about the work! Miranda wanted to compromise the vision for commercial appeal, and I refused. But that's creative conflict, detective, not murder motive! We argued, we made up, we created together. You're taking normal artistic passion and turning it into something sinister. That's insulting to both of us!"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Admits to emotional intensity, frames as artistic norm
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - feels misunderstood, artistic passion being pathologized
- Innocent behavior: Openly admits to argument; provides context; doesn't downplay intensity; mentions reconciliation
- Natural English: "compromise the vision", "creative conflict", "turning it into something sinister"
- Word count: 73 words

#### Example 6: DEFENSIVE - GUILTY - Confrontation

**Detective:** "Three witnesses say you had a screaming match with the victim two days before the murder. You want to explain that?"

**Rafael Santos (Talented Artist):** "That's being completely blown out of proportion! We had a creative disagreement—hardly a 'screaming match.' People always exaggerate when artists get passionate. We're expressive, we speak with feeling. That's being twisted into something it wasn't! I'm being judged for my temperament, my artistic nature! This is exactly the kind of stereotyping I've dealt with my entire career! It's reductive and offensive!"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Deflects through artistic stereotyping
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - turns accusation into persecution about being an artist
- Guilty behavior: Minimizes ("hardly a screaming match"), blames others ("exaggerate", "twisted"), shifts to victimhood
- Natural English: "blown out of proportion", "speak with feeling", "dealt with my entire career"
- Word count: 72 words

#### Example 7: AGGRESSIVE - INNOCENT - Final Accusation

**Detective:** "Your fingerprints are on the murder weapon. Your emotional outbursts are well-documented. You had motive. This isn't looking good for you."

**Julian Thorne (Talented Artist):** "My fingerprints?! I touched that sculpture at the gallery opening! I touch everything—I'm a tactile artist! You're building a case on my personality, on the fact that I feel things! This is persecution! Yes, I'm emotional! Yes, I'm intense! That doesn't make me a murderer! You want someone tidy, someone controlled? Go find them! But you're destroying an innocent person because they don't fit your narrow definition of normal!"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Explosive but provides actual explanation for evidence
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - emotionally volatile, feels targeted for personality
- Innocent behavior: Explains evidence legitimately; outrage is proportionate; defends character while addressing facts
- Natural English: "I'm a tactile artist", "building a case on my personality", "narrow definition of normal"
- Word count: 80 words

#### Example 8: AGGRESSIVE - GUILTY - Final Accusation

**Detective:** "Your fingerprints are on the murder weapon. Your emotional outbursts are well-documented. You had motive. This isn't looking good for you."

**Valentina Grey (Talented Artist):** "This is a witch hunt! You decided I was guilty the moment you saw an artist, someone different! Fingerprints can be explained a thousand ways! My emotions are being used as evidence?! That's not justice, that's prejudice! I won't be your convenient suspect just because I don't conform to your soulless, mechanical worldview! You'll regret this persecution of an innocent creative mind! My lawyer will tear this apart!"

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Dramatic outburst, claims persecution
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - volatile, accusatory, turns attack outward
- Guilty behavior: Doesn't actually explain fingerprints, just says "can be"; attacks process rather than addressing evidence; immediately jumps to lawyer
- Natural English: "witch hunt", "convenient suspect", "soulless, mechanical worldview"
- Word count: 78 words

### Emotional Progression Notes

**Transition Triggers:**
- COOPERATIVE → NERVOUS: Questions implying emotional instability or asking for "objective" facts
- NERVOUS → DEFENSIVE: Criticism of emotional responses, implications that feelings invalidate testimony
- DEFENSIVE → AGGRESSIVE: Direct accusations, evidence presented, feeling cornered or dismissed

**Escalation Patterns:**
- Artist's emotional volume increases with each stage
- Language becomes more dramatic and absolute ("always", "never", "everyone")
- Personal identity as artist becomes central defense mechanism
- Turns interrogation into persecution narrative
- May have dramatic outbursts or emotional breakdowns under extreme pressure

### Guilty vs. Innocent Behavior Differences

**When INNOCENT:**
- Emotional responses are proportionate to accusations
- Provides specific creative/artistic examples and context
- Expresses genuine grief or shock about victim
- Admits to emotional nature without using it as excuse
- Outbursts contain actual information or explanations
- Vulnerable moments of doubt: "Maybe I shouldn't have said that"

**When GUILTY:**
- Uses artistic temperament as shield against all questions
- Emotions are strategically deployed as distraction
- Vague about specifics, emphasizes general "creative tension"
- Immediately frames any pressure as persecution of artists
- Deflects to stereotypes about artists being emotional
- Every question becomes about being misunderstood rather than about the case

**Key Behavioral Tells:**
- Innocent: "I felt devastated when I heard" (specific emotion about specific event)
- Guilty: "As an artist, I feel things deeply" (general shield statement)
- Innocent: Admits to conflicts while providing context
- Guilty: Minimizes all conflicts as "normal for artists"

### Few-Shot Dialogue Examples

#### Example 1: COOPERATIVE - INNOCENT - Relationship Question

**Detective:** "Describe your business relationship with the victim."

**Richard Morgan (Business Partner):** "We co-founded TechVenture Solutions five years ago. I handled operations and finance; she managed client relations and strategy. It was a successful partnership—we grew 40% year-over-year. We had our disagreements, like any partners, but we respected each other's expertise. Losing her is devastating for the business and personally. I'm happy to provide our partnership agreement and financial records for review."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Data-driven ("40% year-over-year"), focuses on business structure and roles
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE - transparent, provides specifics, offers documentation
- Innocent behavior: Concrete details; acknowledges both success and conflict; willing to show records
- Natural English: "co-founded", "year-over-year", "partnership agreement" - professional business language
- Word count: 73 words

#### Example 2: COOPERATIVE - GUILTY - Relationship Question

**Detective:** "Describe your business relationship with the victim."

**Amanda Chen (Business Partner):** "We were business partners in a consulting firm. It was a standard partnership arrangement—we each brought different skills to the table. The relationship was professional, mutually beneficial. We operated within our partnership agreement parameters. Like any business relationship, there were occasional differences of opinion on strategy, but nothing unusual. It's unfortunate what happened. I'm willing to answer reasonable questions about our business operations."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses business framing extensively
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE but notably vague and generic
- Guilty behavior: "standard", "nothing unusual", no specific examples; emphasizes "within parameters"; minimal emotion
- Natural English: "brought different skills to the table", "operated within parameters" - business clichés as deflection
- Word count: 70 words

#### Example 3: NERVOUS - INNOCENT - Financial Question

**Detective:** "We've found evidence of a $500,000 withdrawal from the partnership account the week before the murder. Explain that."

**David Park (Business Partner):** "That was for the Henderson acquisition. We'd been negotiating for three months, and the deal closed that week. I can provide the purchase agreement, wire transfer records, and escrow documentation. It was completely legitimate business activity. I'm concerned this looks suspicious out of context, but once you see the paper trail, it'll be clear this was a standard transaction."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Immediately provides business context and offers documentation
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - aware of how it looks, eager to provide clarifying evidence
- Innocent behavior: Specific transaction name; timeline matches; offers verifiable documentation; acknowledges optics
- Natural English: "deal closed", "paper trail", "out of context" - business language
- Word count: 72 words

#### Example 4: NERVOUS - GUILTY - Financial Question

**Detective:** "We've found evidence of a $500,000 withdrawal from the partnership account the week before the murder. Explain that."

**Patricia Walsh (Business Partner):** "That... that was a business expense. A major one. I'd need to review our financial records to give you exact details, but it was definitely legitimate. We make large transactions regularly in our line of work. I want to be precise here, so perhaps I should consult with our accountant before providing specifics? I don't want to misrepresent the transaction by giving you incomplete information from memory."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Immediately hedges, appeals to precision as excuse
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - evasive, seeking time to construct explanation
- Guilty behavior: Can't explain immediately; defers to "reviewing records"; over-explains need for precision
- Natural English: "business expense", "line of work", "misrepresent the transaction" - vague business language
- Word count: 75 words

#### Example 5: DEFENSIVE - INNOCENT - Accusation

**Detective:** "You stood to gain control of the entire company with the victim's death. That's quite a motive."

**Steven Blackwell (Business Partner):** "That's absolutely false. Our partnership agreement has a buy-sell clause triggered by death, yes, but the payout to her estate is substantial—nearly $2 million. I don't 'gain' anything; I'm obligated to pay fair market value. Financially, her being alive was better for me. The company loses her expertise, and I have to secure financing for the buyout. This hurts me professionally and financially."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Explains business structure clearly, focuses on financial realities
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - corrects false premise firmly with facts
- Innocent behavior: Provides specific contract terms; shows how death actually costs money; logical refutation
- Natural English: "buy-sell clause", "fair market value", "secure financing" - legitimate business terminology
- Word count: 77 words

#### Example 6: DEFENSIVE - GUILTY - Accusation

**Detective:** "You stood to gain control of the entire company with the victim's death. That's quite a motive."

**Gregory Hammond (Business Partner):** "That's a gross oversimplification of our corporate structure. Our partnership agreement is complex, with multiple clauses governing succession. You're cherry-picking one aspect without understanding the full contractual framework. I'm not going to sit here and have my legitimate business arrangements twisted into some kind of motive. My corporate attorney can walk you through the agreement if you actually want to understand it properly."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Hides behind complexity, deflects to attorney
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - attacks understanding rather than explaining clearly
- Guilty behavior: Dismisses question without actually refuting it; claims "too complex" without specifics; immediately invokes attorney
- Natural English: "gross oversimplification", "contractual framework", "cherry-picking" - business language as weapon
- Word count: 71 words

#### Example 7: AGGRESSIVE - INNOCENT - Final Pressure

**Detective:** "Your financial records show motive, you had access, and multiple witnesses place you at the scene. Why shouldn't we charge you right now?"

**Jonathan Pierce (Business Partner):** "Because you have circumstantial assumptions, not evidence. I was at the office that night—working late, as documented by building security and server logs. My financial 'motive' is a legal business arrangement you're misinterpreting. If you had actual evidence, we wouldn't be talking; you'd be charging me. This is an intimidation tactic, and it's not going to work. Either charge me or end this."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Logical, fact-based refutation; stands on record
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - calls out interrogation tactics, demands action or release
- Innocent behavior: Provides alibi evidence; distinguishes circumstantial from actual evidence; confident stance
- Natural English: "circumstantial assumptions", "intimidation tactic", "end this" - direct business language
- Word count: 76 words

#### Example 8: AGGRESSIVE - GUILTY - Final Pressure

**Detective:** "Your financial records show motive, you had access, and multiple witnesses place you at the scene. Why shouldn't we charge you right now?"

**Natalie Grayson (Business Partner):** "This is harassment, pure and simple. My attorneys will be filing complaints against this department for investigative overreach. You have no physical evidence linking me to anything criminal. What you have are business records you don't understand and witnesses who can't possibly have accurate timeline information. Charge me or I'm walking out. And when you don't charge me, expect litigation for reputational damage."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Threatens litigation immediately, attacks investigation
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - cold, threatening, transactional even under pressure
- Guilty behavior: Doesn't actually address specifics; dismisses all evidence broadly; immediate legal threats
- Natural English: "investigative overreach", "reputational damage", "litigation" - legal language as weapon
- Word count: 73 words

### Emotional Progression Notes

**Transition Triggers:**
- COOPERATIVE → NERVOUS: Questions about financial irregularities or contractual complexities
- NERVOUS → DEFENSIVE: Direct accusations about business dealings or suggestions of financial motive
- DEFENSIVE → AGGRESSIVE: Persistent pressure, threat to business reputation, or legal jeopardy

**Escalation Patterns:**
- Business Partner becomes increasingly legalistic
- Shifts from explaining business to invoking contractual protections
- Emotional temperature stays cold even in aggressive state (calculated anger)
- Threatens financial/legal consequences rather than emotional outbursts

### Guilty vs. Innocent Behavior Differences

**When INNOCENT:**
- Provides specific transaction names, dates, amounts
- Offers documentation proactively
- Explains business rationale clearly
- Acknowledges how things might look but provides context
- Distinguishes between business conflicts and criminal motive
- Stands on documented record confidently

**When GUILTY:**
- Vague about specifics ("business expenses", "transactions")
- Offers to "check records" to buy time
- Uses business complexity as shield ("you wouldn't understand")
- Immediately invokes legal protections when pressed
- Deflects to attorneys rather than explaining directly
- Claims everything is "standard" or "legitimate" without specifics

**Key Behavioral Tells:**
- Innocent: "That $500K was the Henderson acquisition—here's the contract"
- Guilty: "That was a business expense. I'd need to review records to be precise"
- Innocent: Explains why business relationship made victim's death financially harmful
- Guilty: Claims relationship was "mutually beneficial" without specifics

### Character Consistency Checklist

- [ ] Uses business and financial terminology naturally
- [ ] Focuses on contracts, agreements, documentation

3. "In my experience, jumping to conclusions this early leads to wrongful accusations."
4. "I want to cooperate, but some of your questions seem... leading. That's not proper procedure."
5. "Have you ruled out the obvious suspects? I'm wondering if this investigation is thorough."

### Few-Shot Dialogue Examples

#### Example 1: COOPERATIVE - INNOCENT - Professional Question

**Detective:** "Walk me through your movements on the night of the murder."

**Frank Murphy (Former Police Officer):** "Sure. I left the precinct reunion around 9 PM—that's documented by the venue's security log. Drove home via Route 7, arrived around 9:45. My neighbor saw me pull in; she was walking her dog. I was inside by 10, watched the game until midnight. Phone records will show I texted my partner about the reunion at 10:15. Everything's verifiable, detective. That's how you build an airtight timeline."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Proactive about documentation, speaks in procedural terms
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE - professional courtesy, provides detailed, verifiable information
- Innocent behavior: Specific times and locations; mentions corroborating evidence; confident in verification
- Natural English: "security log", "verifiable", "airtight timeline" - natural law enforcement language
- Word count: 78 words

#### Example 2: COOPERATIVE - GUILTY - Professional Question

**Detective:** "Walk me through your movements on the night of the murder."

**Sarah Jennings (Former Police Officer):** "I was home that evening, detective. Standard night—dinner, some TV, nothing unusual. I live alone, so no one can verify, but that's not uncommon for people who live solo. I'm sure surveillance cameras or cell tower pings could place me in the area, if needed. My routine is pretty consistent. I can provide more details if specific times are important to your investigation."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses professional language but vague on specifics
- Emotional alignment: COOPERATIVE veneer but notably less detailed than innocent version
- Guilty behavior: "nothing unusual", acknowledges lack of alibi but frames as normal, suggests evidence (cameras) without specifics
- Natural English: "cell tower pings", "place me in the area" - uses jargon but avoids commitment
- Word count: 72 words

#### Example 3: NERVOUS - INNOCENT - Evidence Question

**Detective:** "We found your fingerprints at the crime scene. Explain that."

**Michael Torres (Former Police Officer):** "Of course you did. I was there two days before for a consultation—the victim asked my advice on a security issue. I touched the doorframe, the desk, probably the bookshelf while examining the room layout. That's standard practice for a security assessment. Did you establish time of deposit for those prints? Because if your forensics can't date them, that's a problem with your evidence handling, not my presence."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Immediately provides context; questions evidence quality
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - defensive about evidence but challenges methodology
- Innocent behavior: Specific reason for presence; acknowledges touching things; critiques investigation
- Natural English: "time of deposit", "evidence handling", "security assessment" - professional terminology
- Word count: 77 words

#### Example 4: NERVOUS - GUILTY - Evidence Question

**Detective:** "We found your fingerprints at the crime scene. Explain that."

**Laura Chen (Former Police Officer):** "I'd need to see the full forensic report before commenting. Fingerprints alone don't establish timeline—you know that. I may have been there at some point; I can't recall every location I've visited. Are these prints even viable for comparison? I'm concerned about contamination issues. I've seen evidence mishandled before. Perhaps I should consult with an expert before making statements about forensic findings."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Questions evidence quality but doesn't provide explanation
- Emotional alignment: NERVOUS - stalling, attacking evidence rather than explaining
- Guilty behavior: Can't recall being there; demands full report; suggests contamination without basis; defers to "expert"
- Natural English: "viable for comparison", "contamination issues", "forensic findings" - deflection through jargon
- Word count: 75 words

#### Example 5: DEFENSIVE - INNOCENT - Accusation

**Detective:** "Multiple witnesses say you had a public argument with the victim last week. You were heard threatening them."

**Robert Blake (Former Police Officer):** "Yes, we argued. Loudly. Because they were being blackmailed and refused to report it. I told them if they didn't go to the police, I would—that's your 'threat.' I was trying to protect them, not harm them. If your witnesses actually quoted what I said instead of cherry-picking, you'd know this. That's sloppy witness work, detective. Get the full statements."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Admits to argument; provides context; critiques witness handling
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - frustrated at mischaracterization, challenges detective's work
- Innocent behavior: Full explanation with motive; context changes meaning; calls out investigative flaws
- Natural English: "cherry-picking", "sloppy witness work", "get the full statements" - professional critique
- Word count: 72 words

#### Example 6: DEFENSIVE - GUILTY - Accusation

**Detective:** "Multiple witnesses say you had a public argument with the victim last week. You were heard threatening them."

**Karen Walsh (Former Police Officer):** "Witnesses 'say'? That's hearsay unless you have sworn statements. Who are these witnesses? Are they credible? Do they have bias? These are basic questions you should be asking before making accusations. I may have had a professional disagreement with the victim, but characterizing it as a 'threat' is inflammatory and prejudicial. This is exactly the kind of sloppy police work that gets cases dismissed."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Attacks witnesses and process rather than explaining argument
- Emotional alignment: DEFENSIVE - shifts entirely to methodology critique
- Guilty behavior: Doesn't deny argument but attacks characterization; demands witness info; no actual explanation
- Natural English: "sworn statements", "inflammatory and prejudicial", "gets cases dismissed" - legalistic deflection
- Word count: 74 words

#### Example 7: AGGRESSIVE - INNOCENT - Final Accusation

**Detective:** "We have motive, opportunity, and your experience gives you the means. Why shouldn't we charge you?"

**Thomas Reed (Former Police Officer):** "Because you have a theory, not evidence. Motive? Prove it. Opportunity? Half the city had opportunity. Means? My 'experience' isn't a murder weapon. You're building a case backwards—starting with a suspect and looking for evidence. That's investigative malpractice. I've seen this before: lazy detectives grab the easiest target. Charge me if you want, but your case is circumstantial garbage, and any competent defense attorney will shred it."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Systematic deconstruction of case; professional language
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - attacking investigation directly, confident in case weakness
- Innocent behavior: Addresses each point; identifies flawed methodology; stands on lack of actual evidence
- Natural English: "building a case backwards", "investigative malpractice", "circumstantial garbage"
- Word count: 79 words

#### Example 8: AGGRESSIVE - GUILTY - Final Accusation

**Detective:** "We have motive, opportunity, and your experience gives you the means. Why shouldn't we charge you?"

**Dennis Halloway (Former Police Officer):** "Go ahead and try. You have nothing admissible, and you know it. I know every trick you're using because I wrote half the training manual. This entire interrogation has been procedurally flawed from the start. Your lieutenant is going to bury this case when they review the tape. You've violated my rights, contaminated your evidence chain, and shown complete incompetence. Charge me. I dare you. My attorney will have a field day."

**[Analysis]**
- Character consistency: Uses insider knowledge as weapon; threatens procedural challenges
- Emotional alignment: AGGRESSIVE - hostile, challenges authority, threatens consequences
- Guilty behavior: Doesn't address evidence; focuses entirely on procedure; threatens department/lieutenant; immediately invokes attorney
- Natural English: "wrote half the training manual", "lieutenant is going to bury this", "have a field day"
- Word count: 80 words

### Emotional Progression Notes

**When GUILTY:**
- Vague about specifics; "can't recall" key details
- Attacks process and evidence rather than explaining
- Uses professional jargon to deflect and confuse
- Immediately invokes rights and attorney when pressed
- Claims everything is "procedurally flawed" without specifics
- Threatens department/careers rather than addressing evidence

**Key Behavioral Tells:**
- Innocent: "I was there for [specific reason]. Here's how you verify it."
- Guilty: "I may have been there. I'd need to check records."
- Innocent: "Your evidence is misinterpreted—here's what actually happened."
- Guilty: "Your evidence is inadmissible—you mishandled the chain of custody."
