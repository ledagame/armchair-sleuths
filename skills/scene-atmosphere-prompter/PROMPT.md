## COMPOSITION & FRAMING

### Cinematic Composition Rules

**Rule of Thirds:** Place key elements on intersecting points
**Leading Lines:** Use architectural elements to guide viewer's eye
**Depth:** Create layers (foreground, midground, background)
**Symmetry/Asymmetry:** Use intentionally for dramatic effect

### Camera Angles

**Low Angle:** Creates imposing, ominous feeling
**High Angle:** Suggests vulnerability or overview
**Dutch Angle:** Adds unease and tension (use sparingly)
**Eye Level:** Realistic, grounded perspective

### Focal Points

- Draw attention to narrative-important elements
- Use lighting to highlight key props
- Create visual interest through composition
- Balance detail with atmospheric mood
