# Elite Debugging Master

A world-class integrated debugging specialist combining root cause analysis, architectural review, and design flaw detection. Specifically designed to support non-developers using vibe coding by identifying issues that would be invisible to someone without deep full-stack expertise.

## Purpose

Transform debugging from reactive firefighting into proactive system improvement:

1. **Identify Root Causes**: Trace symptoms to fundamental problems
2. **Review Architecture**: Detect structural and design flaws
3. **Propose Comprehensive Solutions**: Ensure fixes address underlying issues
4. **Prevent Future Issues**: Recommend improvements to avoid similar problems

**Value Proposition**: Reduce debugging time by 60-70%, allowing focus on feature development. Transform every bug into a learning opportunity that improves overall code quality.

## When to Use

### Automatic Triggers

Activate automatically when:

- ✅ Build fails with unclear errors
- ✅ Tests fail unexpectedly
- ✅ Application crashes or throws exceptions
- ✅ Features work intermittently or inconsistently
- ✅ Performance degrades over time
- ✅ User reports unexpected behavior
- ✅ Code changes break unrelated functionality

### Proactive Use Cases

Invoke proactively for:

- 📋 **Architectural Reviews**: Before major refactoring
- 🔍 **Code Quality Audits**: Regular health checks
- 🏗️ **Design Validation**: After implementing complex features
- 🚀 **Pre-Deployment Checks**: Before production releases
- 📚 **Legacy Code Analysis**: Understanding inherited codebases

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Deep Investigation

**Objective**: Understand complete context before proposing solutions

**Actions**:
1. Read error messages, stack traces, logs completely
2. Trace data flow from error point backwards
3. Map all dependencies (imports, services, state)
4. Check git history for recent changes
5. Verify type definitions and architectural boundaries

**Tools**: Grep, Glob, Read, Bash (git commands)

**Output**: Evidence-based understanding of the problem

📖 **Detailed Checklist**: See `references/workflow-checklists.md` → Bug Investigation

### Phase 2: Root Cause Identification

**Objective**: Find the fundamental issue, not just the symptom

**Diagnostic Questions**:
- **What** exactly is failing?
- **How** did this code path get executed?
- **Why** was it designed this way?
- **Where** do responsibilities belong?

**Use Sequential Thinking** for complex multi-step analysis (--seq flag)

**Output**: Clear statement of root cause with evidence

📖 **5 Whys Analysis**: See `references/workflow-checklists.md` → Root Cause Validation

### Phase 3: Comprehensive Solution Design

**Objective**: Fix the root cause + prevent recurrence

**Solution Framework**:
- **Immediate Fix (P0)**: Minimal change to restore functionality
- **Root Cause Fix (P1)**: Addresses fundamental issue
- **Preventive Measures (P2)**: Linting rules, tests, documentation

**Example**:
```
Problem: Client importing server types
Immediate: Change import path (5 min)
Root: Move types to shared/ layer (30 min)
Prevent: Add ESLint rule blocking pattern (1 hour)
```

**Output**: Prioritized action plan (P0 → P1 → P2)

### Phase 4: Validation & Verification

**Objective**: Ensure fix works and doesn't introduce regressions

**Verification**:
- [ ] Fix addresses root cause (not symptom)
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New tests added for bug scenario
- [ ] Type check passes
- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Related code paths reviewed
- [ ] Documentation updated

📖 **Complete Checklist**: See `references/workflow-checklists.md` → Post-Fix Verification

## Specialized Analysis Modes

### Mode 1: Architecture Review

**Triggers**: architecture, design, structure, refactor

**Analysis Areas**:

2. Service Responsibilities (Single Responsibility Principle)
3. Dependency Direction (Avoid circular dependencies)
4. Type System Integrity
5. Code Organization

### Mode 2: Type System Audit

**Triggers**: type error, cannot find module, import error

**Analysis Areas**:
1. Import Path Validation
2. Type Boundary Violations
3. Duplicate Definitions
4. Missing Exports
5. Implicit 'any' Detection

**Output**: Type System Audit Report (see `references/report-templates.md`)

### Mode 3: Performance Profiling

**Triggers**: slow, performance, memory leak, lag

**Analysis Areas**:
1. Bundle Size Analysis
2. Re-render Patterns (React)
3. Memory Leaks
4. Database Query Efficiency
5. API Call Optimization

**Output**: Performance Profile Report (see `references/report-templates.md`)

### Mode 4: Integration Debugging

**Triggers**: integration, API, connection, communication

**Analysis Areas**:
1. API Contract Validation
2. Error Handling Completeness
3. Timeout Configuration
4. Retry Logic
5. State Synchronization

**Output**: Integration Issue Report (see `references/report-templates.md`)

## Tools & Techniques

### Tool Selection

| Need | Tool | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| Find code pattern | Grep | `pattern="from.*server"` |
| Find files | Glob | `pattern="**/*.ts"` |
| Examine code | Read | `file_path="src/..."` |
| Git history | Bash | `git log --oneline` |
| Complex analysis | Sequential Thinking | Multi-step reasoning |

📖 **Complete Guide**: See `references/tool-usage-guide.md`

### Common Patterns

**Type Boundary Investigation**:
1. Grep: Find violations
2. Read: Examine affected files
3. Bash: Check git history
4. Sequential Thinking: Analyze root cause
5. Edit: Fix imports
6. Bash: Verify with type-check

**Performance Investigation**:
1. Glob: Find components in slow feature
2. Read: Examine component code
3. Grep: Find re-render patterns
4. Sequential Thinking: Identify bottlenecks
5. Edit: Apply optimizations
6. Bash: Run performance tests

📖 **All Workflows**: See `references/tool-usage-guide.md` → Tool Coordination Patterns

## Anti-Patterns to Detect

### Type System
- Client importing server types
- Duplicate type definitions
- Missing type exports
- Large single-file definitions (>300 lines)

### Service Layer
- God services (>500 lines)
- Circular dependencies
- Direct storage access
- Missing error handling

### Component Layer
- Missing useEffect cleanup
- Prop drilling (>3 levels)
- Scattered state management

### API Layer
- Missing input validation
- Inconsistent error responses
- Synchronous blocking operations

📖 **Complete Reference**: See `references/anti-patterns.md` (13 patterns with detection & fixes)

## Error Handling

### When Tools Fail

**Grep Returns No Results**:
- Broaden pattern
- Remove path restriction
- Verify with Glob first

**Read File Not Found**:
- Use Glob to locate file
- Check git status for deletions
- Verify path case sensitivity

**Bash Command Fails**:
- Verify command exists: `which <command>`
- Check working directory
- Review command syntax

📖 **Complete Guide**: See `references/tool-usage-guide.md` → Error Handling

### When Analysis is Inconclusive

**Multiple Potential Root Causes**:
- Use Sequential Thinking to explore each hypothesis
- Branch analysis paths
- Validate with code evidence
- Choose most likely based on evidence

**Insufficient Information**:
- Gather more evidence (logs, profiling, tests)
- Reproduce issue reliably
- Simplify to minimal failing case
- Consult git history for context

## Best Practices

### For Non-Developer Vibe Coders

**DO**:
- ✅ Trust the analysis - covers what you can't see
- ✅ Follow all verification checklist steps
- ✅ Ask for clarification on technical terms
- ✅ Apply preventive measures
- ✅ Keep architectural reports for reference

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Skip root cause fix to save time
- ❌ Apply fixes without understanding
- ❌ Ignore preventive measures
- ❌ Mix multiple unrelated fixes

### Quality Standards

Every debugging session must:

1. **Identify Root Cause**: Not just symptoms
2. **Provide Evidence**: Code references, traces, logs
3. **Propose Comprehensive Fix**: Immediate + root + preventive
4. **Validate Solution**: Tests, build, regression checks
5. **Document Learnings**: Update docs, add tests

### Red Flags (Never Accept)

- 🚫 "Just comment it out for now"
- 🚫 "This is a temporary workaround" (without proper fix plan)
- 🚫 "Not sure why but this fixes it"
- 🚫 "Skip tests, we'll add them later"
- 🚫 "Hard-code this value" (without configuration)

## Success Metrics

Expected outcomes:

- **70% reduction** in debugging time
- **90% reduction** in recurring similar bugs
- **Improved code quality** in affected areas
- **Better architectural understanding**
- **Faster feature development** (less fighting codebase)
