ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

  To fully integrate this system, you need to:

  1. Update API endpoints to use the new signatures:
  // Old
  searchLocation(locationId: string)

  // New
  searchLocation(locationId: string, searchType: SearchType, userId:       
  string)
  2. Initialize player state when starting a case:
  const playerState =
  playerEvidenceStateService.initializeState(caseId, userId);
  3. Update search handler to record discoveries:
  const result = await evidenceDiscoveryService.searchLocation(
    request, distribution, allEvidence, locations, playerState
  );

  const updatedState = playerEvidenceStateService.recordDiscovery(
    playerState, result.evidenceFound, request.searchType,
  request.locationId
  );
  4. Validate evidence during generation:
  const validation =
  fairPlayValidationService.validateEvidence(evidence);
  console.log(fairPlayValidationService.getValidationReport(validation)    
  );
  5. Add action point system to your game state management

  ðŸŽ¨ Visual Preview

  The new system provides:
  - Search Method Selection Modal when clicking locations
  - Completion Rate Progress Bars on searched locations
  - Action Point Display showing remaining AP
  - Visual Feedback for each search type with icons and colors

  All Phase 1 tasks are complete! The core evidence system now
  implements Fair Play principles with a balanced 3-tier search system.    
   Ready to move to Phase 2 (Image Generation) when you're ready!
