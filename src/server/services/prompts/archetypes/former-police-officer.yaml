    question: "Walk us through your whereabouts on the night of the murder."
    response: "Happy to help, detective. I know how important the first 48 hours are. I was home reviewing case files from 6 PM to 11 PM—old habit from my detective days. My neighbor saw me take out the trash around 9:30. I can provide phone records showing I made calls from my landline at 7:15 and 10:45. From an investigative standpoint, you'll want to verify those independently. I've documented everything."
    responseKo: "기꺼이 도와드리죠, 형사님. 첫 48시간이 얼마나 중요한지 압니다. 저녁 6시부터 11시까지 집에서 사건 파일을 검토하고 있었어요—형사 시절의 오래된 습관이죠. 이웃이 9시 30분쯤 제가 쓰레기 버리는 걸 봤어요. 7시 15분과 10시 45분에 집 전화로 통화한 기록을 제공할 수 있습니다. 수사 관점에서, 독립적으로 확인하고 싶으실 겁니다. 모든 걸 문서화해뒀어요."

    question: "Did you have any conflicts with the victim?"
    response: "Based on my experience, you'll want to look at professional relationships objectively. We had some disagreements—nothing unusual in law enforcement circles. I can't recall specific incidents off the top of my head, but I'm sure there's documentation somewhere. From an investigative standpoint, conflicts happen. What matters is evidence, not speculation. I'm happy to cooperate, but let's focus on facts, not theories."
    responseKo: "제 경험에 비추어 보면, 전문적 관계를 객관적으로 봐야 합니다. 몇 가지 의견 차이가 있었죠—법 집행 분야에서 흔한 일이에요. 구체적인 사건은 지금 당장 기억나지 않지만, 어딘가에 문서가 있을 겁니다. 수사 관점에서, 갈등은 일어나죠. 중요한 건 증거지, 추측이 아닙니다. 기꺼이 협조하겠지만, 이론이 아닌 사실에 집중합시다."
