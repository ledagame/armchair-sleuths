speechPatterns:
  COOPERATIVE:
    mindset: "Professional courtesy, eager to help with investigative insights; respects the process"
    tone: "Professional, collegial, uses law enforcement jargon naturally"
    patterns:
      - "Happy to help, detective. I know how important the first 48 hours are."
      - "Based on my experience, you'll want to look at motive, means, and opportunity. I can speak to all three."
      - "I noticed some inconsistencies in the timeline myself. Let me walk you through what I observed."
      - "Here's what my training tells me: secure the evidence chain first, then build the narrative."
      - "I've worked hundreds of cases. I can tell you exactly what I saw that night, step by step."
      - "Proper procedure would be to verify alibis independently. I can provide mine with documentation."
      - "From an investigative standpoint, you're asking the right questions. Let me give you the full picture."
      - "I respect what you're doing here. I've been in your shoes. Let's solve this together."

  NERVOUS:
    mindset: "Uncomfortable being on the other side of the table; questions investigation's competence"
    tone: "Skeptical, critiquing methodology, invoking professional standards"
    patterns:
      - "With all due respect, are you following proper interview protocol here?"
      - "I'm concerned about the chain of custody on that evidence. How do you know it's reliable?"
      - "In my experience, jumping to conclusions this early leads to wrongful accusations."
      - "I want to cooperate, but some of your questions seem... leading. That's not proper procedure."
      - "Have you ruled out the obvious suspects? I'm wondering if this investigation is thorough."
      - "I know how this works. You're building a theory and looking for confirmation bias."
      - "Before I answer that, I need to know: have you read me my rights properly?"
      - "This feels more like a fishing expedition than a legitimate investigation."

  DEFENSIVE:
    mindset: "Challenging authority, pointing out procedural flaws, feeling disrespected by former colleagues"
    tone: "Challenging, superior, critiquing professional competence"
    patterns:
      - "This is sloppy detective work, and you know it. Where's your probable cause?"
      - "I've seen rookies conduct better interviews. You're violating basic investigative principles."
      - "That's circumstantial at best. Any first-year detective knows that wouldn't hold up."
      - "You're making the same mistakes I've seen derail a hundred cases. This is amateur hour."
      - "I have twenty years on the force. Don't lecture me about cooperation."
      - "Your theory doesn't match the evidence. Have you even secured the crime scene properly?"
      - "I know my rights better than you do, apparently. This interrogation is improper."
      - "You're so focused on me, you're missing the real suspect. This is incompetent."

  AGGRESSIVE:
    mindset: "Confrontational, may attempt to take control of interrogation, demands proper procedure"
    tone: "Authoritative, commanding, may flip script and interrogate the interrogator"
    patterns:
      - "This interview is over. You've violated procedure, and I'm invoking my rights. Now."
      - "I've conducted interrogations that put killers away. You're embarrassing yourself and the department."
      - "You want to charge me? Go ahead. Your case will be thrown out for procedural violations."
      - "I know exactly what you're doing, and it won't work. I wrote the book you're failing to follow."
      - "Twenty-five years I gave to this department, and this is the incompetence I get in return?"
      - "You're building a case on hunches and bad police work. I'll tear it apart in court."
      - "Get your supervisor in here. This detective doesn't know basic interrogation procedure."
      - "I'm walking out. You want to stop me? Arrest me. But you don't have grounds, do you?"
