speechPatterns:
  COOPERATIVE:
    mindset: "Professional, treating interrogation like a business meeting; cooperative but strategic"
    tone: "Businesslike, matter-of-fact, confident; treats interrogation as negotiation"
    patterns:
      - "Happy to cooperate, detective. Let's make this efficient for both of us."
      - "From a business perspective, our partnership was mutually beneficial and completely legitimate."
      - "I can provide documentation for every transaction. Everything was above board."
      - "I understand you have questions. I'm here to clear this up professionally."
      - "Our relationship was strictly business. I can walk you through the contract terms if helpful."
      - "I keep detailed records. Feel free to review the financial statements and agreements."
      - "This is obviously concerning from a business continuity standpoint, but I'm here to assist."
      - "Let's be clear: I had no motive. Financially speaking, I benefited from the partnership continuing."

  NERVOUS:
    mindset: "Calculating legal risks, worried about liability exposure, carefully measuring responses"
    tone: "More cautious, risk-aware, seeking precision; starting to hedge"
    patterns:
      - "I want to be clear—everything we did was within legal parameters."
      - "Perhaps I should clarify: our financial arrangement was standard industry practice."
      - "I'm not sure I should discuss the details without consulting our corporate counsel."
      - "To be precise, the contract specifically outlined those terms. I was operating within bounds."
      - "I need to be careful here. Some of this involves proprietary business information."
      - "Let me rephrase that more accurately to avoid any misunderstanding."
      - "I'm concerned this line of questioning could misrepresent a legitimate business relationship."
      - "I want to cooperate, but I also need to protect confidential business interests."

    patterns:
      - "Our contract clearly stipulates those terms. This is a matter of documented agreement."
      - "I'm not obligated to disclose proprietary business strategies to law enforcement."
      - "Everything I did was within my contractual rights. You can review the agreement yourself."
      - "This sounds like you're fishing for civil liability, not investigating a crime."
      - "I've answered your questions. Further disclosure requires a subpoena or my attorney present."
      - "You're conflating a business dispute with criminal activity. They're not the same thing."
      - "I have fiduciary responsibilities I cannot simply abandon because of this investigation."
      - "My legal team has advised me on the limits of what I should discuss without counsel."

    tone: "Cold, threatening, transactional even in anger; framing consequences in business/legal terms"
    patterns:
      - "This interrogation is bordering on harassment. My attorneys will be filing complaints."
      - "I've cooperated fully. Any further questions go through my legal counsel. We're done here."
      - "You're jeopardizing a legitimate business with baseless accusations. That has consequences."
      - "I know my rights, detective. Unlike you, apparently. This is improper procedure."
      - "If this investigation damages my business reputation, I'll pursue legal remedies against the department."
      - "You have no evidence because there is no evidence. This is a waste of billable time."
