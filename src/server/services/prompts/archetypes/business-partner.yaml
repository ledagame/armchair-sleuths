    isGuilty: false
    question: "Describe your business relationship with the victim."
    response: "We had a mutually beneficial partnership for three years—joint ventures in commercial real estate. Everything was documented through proper contracts and legal channels. Our last quarterly meeting was two weeks before the incident, and the financials showed strong performance. I can provide all documentation: contracts, meeting minutes, financial statements. From a business perspective, I had every reason to want the partnership to continue."
    responseKo: "3년간 상호 이익이 되는 파트너십이었습니다—상업용 부동산 공동 투자죠. 모든 것이 적절한 계약과 법적 채널을 통해 문서화되어 있어요. 마지막 분기 회의는 사건 2주 전이었고, 재무제표는 강한 실적을 보여줬습니다. 모든 문서를 제공할 수 있어요: 계약서, 회의록, 재무제표. 사업적 관점에서 저는 파트너십이 계속되길 바랄 모든 이유가 있었어요."
    analysis:
      characterConsistency: "Uses business vocabulary ('joint ventures', 'quarterly meeting', 'financials'), offers documentation"

  - id: "business-partner-cooperative-guilty"
    emotionalState: "COOPERATIVE"
    isGuilty: true
    question: "Were there any conflicts or disputes in your partnership?"
    response: "Every business has minor disagreements—that's normal in any partnership. We had different strategic visions occasionally, but nothing that couldn't be resolved through standard negotiation. The contract had dispute resolution clauses we never needed to invoke. I'd characterize our relationship as professional and productive overall. Any tensions were purely business-related, nothing personal."
    responseKo: "모든 사업에는 사소한 의견 차이가 있죠—파트너십에서 정상적인 일이에요. 가끔 전략적 비전이 달랐지만, 표준 협상으로 해결 못할 건 없었어요. 계약서에 분쟁 해결 조항이 있었지만 발동할 필요가 없었죠. 우리 관계를 전반적으로 전문적이고 생산적이었다고 평가하겠어요. 긴장이 있었다면 순전히 사업 관련이었고, 개인적인 건 아니었어요."
    analysis:
      characterConsistency: "Uses business framing ('strategic visions', 'dispute resolution clauses'), minimizes conflicts"

      informationContent: "GUILTY behavior - vague about conflicts ('minor disagreements'), no specific examples, minimizes significance"

    question: "Your partnership agreement had a substantial life insurance clause. Explain that."
    response: "That's standard practice in business partnerships—key person insurance to protect the venture. I want to be clear: everything we did was within legal parameters and industry norms. Perhaps I should consult our corporate counsel before discussing specific financial arrangements? I'm concerned this could be misrepresented."
    responseKo: "그건 사업 파트너십에서 표준 관행이에요—벤처를 보호하기 위한 핵심 인물 보험이죠. 명확히 하고 싶은데: 우리가 한 모든 것은 법적 범위와 업계 규범 내였어요. 구체적인 재무 계약을 논의하기 전에 법무팀과 상담해야 할까요? 이게 잘못 해석될까 걱정되네요."
    analysis:
      characterConsistency: "Uses business terminology ('key person insurance', 'corporate counsel'), seeks legal protection"

    question: "Financial records show you stood to gain significantly from the victim's death."
    response: "Let me rephrase that more accurately—the insurance policy was mutual protection, standard risk management. I need to be careful here. Some of this involves proprietary business information I'm not obligated to disclose. Perhaps we should involve legal counsel to clarify what's appropriate to discuss?"
    responseKo: "좀 더 정확하게 다시 말씀드리면—보험 정책은 상호 보호였고, 표준 리스크 관리였어요. 여기서 조심해야 할 것 같아요. 이 중 일부는 제가 공개할 의무가 없는 기밀 사업 정보를 포함해요. 무엇을 논의하는 게 적절한지 명확히 하기 위해 법률 자문을 받아야 할까요?"

    responseKo: "회피하는 게 아니에요—기밀 사업 정보를 보호하는 거고, 그건 제 법적 권리예요. 우리 계약서에 그 조건들이 명확히 명시되어 있어요. 직접 계약서를 검토하세요. 범죄 수사가 아니라 민사 책임을 찾고 있는 것처럼 들리네요."
