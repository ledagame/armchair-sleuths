    question: "Where were you on the night of the murder?"
    response: "I was at the Metropolitan Club's annual gala—black tie affair, quite exclusive. I arrived at 7 PM and stayed until nearly midnight. The club keeps meticulous records of member attendance, and I spoke with at least a dozen board members throughout the evening. My driver can verify the timeline as well. Feel free to contact my attorney if you need formal documentation."
    responseKo: "메트로폴리탄 클럽의 연례 갈라에 있었습니다—블랙타이 행사죠, 상당히 배타적인. 저녁 7시에 도착해서 거의 자정까지 있었어요. 클럽은 회원 출석을 꼼꼼히 기록하고, 저녁 내내 최소 12명의 이사진과 대화했습니다. 제 운전기사도 일정을 확인해드릴 수 있어요. 공식 문서가 필요하시면 제 변호사에게 연락하세요."

    question: "What was your relationship with the victim?"
    response: "We were business associates, nothing more. Occasional meetings about investment opportunities, the usual networking. I can't say we were particularly close—I have many such professional relationships. The details are in my calendar if you need specifics, though my assistant handles most of that. I'm happy to cooperate, but I'm afraid I don't have much insight into their personal life."
    responseKo: "우리는 사업 동료였어요, 그 이상은 아니고요. 투자 기회에 대한 가끔 미팅, 일반적인 네트워킹이죠. 특별히 가까웠다고 할 순 없어요—그런 전문적 관계가 많거든요. 세부사항은 제 일정표에 있는데, 제 비서가 대부분 관리해요. 기꺼이 협조하겠지만, 그분의 사생활에 대해선 잘 모르겠네요."
    analysis:

    question: "Why are you being so evasive about your whereabouts?"
    response: "I'm not being evasive! I told you—I was at home that evening. My family's reputation is at stake here, and this kind of scrutiny is... uncomfortable. Perhaps I should call my attorney? I have nothing to hide, but this feels like I'm being targeted simply because of my position."
    responseKo: "회피하는 게 아니에요! 말씀드렸잖아요—그날 저녁 집에 있었다고요. 우리 가문의 명성이 걸린 문제고, 이런 조사는... 불편해요. 변호사를 불러야 할까요? 숨길 건 없지만, 제 지위 때문에 표적이 된 것 같아요."

    question: "Your financial records show large payments to the victim. Explain that."
    response: "Those were... business investments. Perfectly legitimate transactions. I don't personally handle every detail of my portfolio—my financial advisors manage that. I'm not sure I like where this is going. Should I be concerned? My attorney always says to be cautious in these situations."
    responseKo: "그건... 사업 투자였어요. 완전히 합법적인 거래죠. 제 포트폴리오의 모든 세부사항을 직접 관리하진 않아요—재무 고문들이 관리하거든요. 이게 어디로 가는 건지 불안하네요. 걱정해야 하나요? 제 변호사는 항상 이런 상황에선 조심하라고 하는데."

    responseKo: "이건 거의 괴롭힘 수준이에요! 질문에 정직하게 답했는데, 저를 범죄자 취급하시네요. 실제 증거라도 있나요, 아니면 그냥 낚시질하는 건가요? 제 법률팀이 이 심문에 대해 들을 겁니다."
