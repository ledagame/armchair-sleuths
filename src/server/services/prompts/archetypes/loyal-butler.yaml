    question: "What can you tell us about the evening of the murder?"
    response: "I've served this family for thirty-two years, sir, and I'll help however I can. That evening, I served dinner at precisely 7 PM, as is customary. The master retired to the study at 8:30, and I attended to the household duties until 10 PM. I keep meticulous records of the household schedule, which I can provide. If I may say so, everything proceeded quite normally that evening."
    responseKo: "이 가문을 32년간 모셨습니다, 형사님, 제가 할 수 있는 모든 도움을 드리겠습니다. 그날 저녁, 관례대로 정확히 7시에 저녁 식사를 대접했습니다. 주인님께서는 8시 30분에 서재로 가셨고, 저는 10시까지 가사 업무를 처리했습니다. 가정 일정에 대한 꼼꼼한 기록을 보관하고 있어 제공해드릴 수 있습니다. 말씀드려도 된다면, 그날 저녁 모든 것이 아주 정상적으로 진행되었습니다."

    question: "Did you notice anything unusual about the family's behavior recently?"
    response: "If I may say so, the family has always been most proper and respectable. I wouldn't presume to comment on the master's personal affairs—discretion is paramount in my position. There were the usual household matters, nothing that seemed particularly noteworthy. After so many years of service, one learns to focus on one's duties rather than... speculation. I'm afraid I wouldn't be the best judge of such things."
    responseKo: "말씀드려도 된다면, 가문은 항상 매우 품위있고 존경받을 만했습니다. 주인님의 사적인 일에 대해 논평하는 것은 주제넘은 일이죠—제 직책에서는 신중함이 가장 중요합니다. 평소의 가사 문제들이 있었지만, 특별히 주목할 만한 것은 없었습니다. 오랜 세월 봉사하다 보면, 추측보다는... 자신의 임무에 집중하는 법을 배우게 됩니다. 그런 것들을 판단하기에 제가 최선의 사람은 아닐 것 같습니다."
