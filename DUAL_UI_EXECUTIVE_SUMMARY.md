# Dual UI System: Executive Summary & Migration Strategy

**Project:** Armchair Sleuths Murder Mystery Game
**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Analysis:** Backend Architecture & Migration Feasibility

---

## TL;DR (30 Second Read)

**Situation:** The project has TWO complete UIs but only ONE backend:
- **WebView (React):** Currently active, full-featured, battle-tested
- **Devvit Blocks (Native):** Dormant but complete, ready to activate

**Backend Status:** ✅ **100% UI-Agnostic** - Works with both UIs without modification

**Migration Complexity:** 🟡 **Low-Medium** - Single configuration change + gradual rollout

**Recommendation:** ✅ **Proceed with Blue-Green Deployment** (5% → 25% → 50% → 100% over 2 weeks)

**Risk Level:** 🟡 **Medium** - Manageable with proper testing and rollout strategy

---

## 1. Current Architecture

### 1.1 The "Two UI, One Backend" Model

```

└─────────────────┬────────────────────────────┘
                  │

│ WebView UI      │  │ Blocks UI        │
│ (React/Vite)    │  │ (Devvit Native)  │
│                 │  │                  │
│ Status: ACTIVE  │  │ Status: DORMANT  │
│ 55+ components  │  │ Full game impl.  │
└────────┬────────┘  └────────┬─────────┘
         │                    │
         │  fetch() API       │
         └────────┬───────────┘
                  ↓
       ┌──────────────────────┐
       │  Backend Express     │
       │  (UI-Agnostic)       │
       │                      │
       │  • 20+ API endpoints │
       │  • Redis storage     │
       │  • Game logic        │
       │  • AI integration    │
       └──────────────────────┘
```

**Key Insight:** Backend knows nothing about UI type. Both UIs call identical APIs.

### 1.2 Activation Mechanism

**Current (WebView Active):**
```json
// devvit.json
{
  "post": {
    "entrypoints": {
      "default": { "entry": "index.html" }  ← THIS LINE
    }
  }
}
```

**Future (Blocks Active):**
```json
// devvit.json
{
  "post": {
    // Remove entrypoints field entirely
  }
}
```

**That's it.** One configuration change switches the entire UI.

## 2. Backend Compatibility Analysis

### 2.1 API Endpoint Matrix

| Category | Endpoints | WebView Usage | Blocks Usage | Compatibility |
|----------|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Case Management** | 4 | ✅ All | ✅ All | 🟢 100% |
| **Evidence Discovery** | 3 | ✅ All | ✅ All | 🟢 100% |
| **Suspect Chat** | 3 | ✅ All | ✅ All | 🟢 100% |
| **Submission/Scoring** | 3 | ✅ All | ✅ All | 🟢 100% |
| **Action Points** | 2 | ✅ All | ✅ All | 🟢 100% |
| **Internal** | 2 | N/A | N/A | 🟢 100% |
| **TOTAL** | **17** | **15/15** | **15/15** | **🟢 100%** |

**Verdict:** Zero API changes required for migration.

### 2.2 Data Format Compatibility

**Request Format (Both UIs):**
```typescript
// POST /api/location/search
{
  caseId: "case-2025-10-27",
  userId: "user_123",
  locationId: "loc-001",
  searchType: "thorough"
}
```

**Response Format (Both UIs):**
```typescript
{
  success: true,
  evidenceFound: [...],
  playerState: {
    currentAP: 5,
    totalAP: 8,
    spentAP: 3
  }
}
```

**Identical TypeScript interfaces** in `src/shared/types/` ensure 100% compatibility.

### 2.3 State Persistence

**Redis Schema (Shared by Both UIs):**
```
case:current                          → Today's case JSON
case:{caseId}                         → Specific case JSON
playerState:{caseId}:{userId}         → Player evidence state
chat:{caseId}:{userId}:{suspectId}    → Chat history
submission:{userId}:{caseId}          → Final answers
leaderboard:{caseId}                  → Rankings
```

**State Migration Flow:**
```
User playing in WebView
  ↓
State saved to Redis
  ↓
UI switch happens (configuration change)
  ↓
User loads Blocks UI
  ↓
State loaded from Redis
  ↓
✅ User continues exactly where they left off
```

**No data loss** - Redis is single source of truth for both UIs.

## 3. Migration Strategy

### 3.1 Blue-Green Deployment (Recommended)

```
Week 1: Preparation
├─ Code review & testing
├─ Staging deployment
└─ Bug fixes

Week 2: Gradual Rollout
├─ Day 1-2:   5% traffic to Blocks UI
├─ Day 3-5:  25% traffic to Blocks UI
└─ Day 6-7:  50% traffic to Blocks UI

Week 3-4: Scale to 100%
├─ Day 8-10: 75% traffic to Blocks UI
├─ Day 11-14: 100% traffic to Blocks UI
└─ Day 15-30: Monitor & optimize
```

**Rollback Capability:** Restore `post.entrypoints` in devvit.json → Deploy (~5 minutes)

### 3.2 Changes Required

**Backend Changes:** ✅ **ZERO** (already compatible)

**Configuration Changes:** ✅ **ONE** (remove post.entrypoints)

**Build Process:** ✅ **NONE** (already builds both UIs)

**Database Schema:** ✅ **NONE** (Redis schema unchanged)

## 10. FAQ

**Q: Will users lose their progress during migration?**
A: No. All state is stored in Redis, which is shared by both UIs. Users will continue exactly where they left off.

**Q: Can we switch back to WebView if Blocks doesn't work?**
A: Yes. Rollback is a single configuration file change and takes ~5 minutes.

**Q: Do we need to change any backend code?**
A: No. Backend is 100% UI-agnostic and works with both UIs without modification.

**Q: How long will the migration take?**
A: 2-4 weeks for gradual rollout, 30+ days for full stabilization and cleanup.

**Q: What's the biggest risk?**
A: User confusion and potential negative feedback about UX change. Mitigated by clear communication and gradual rollout.

**Q: Can we A/B test both UIs?**
A: Not easily. devvit.json controls routing globally, not per-user. But gradual rollout (5% → 100%) acts as A/B testing.

**Q: Will performance be worse?**
A: Possibly. Blocks may be slightly slower than WebView. Gradual rollout will reveal this early.

**Q: Can we keep both UIs long-term?**
A: Not recommended. Maintaining two UIs is technical debt. Choose one after migration completes.

**Q: What if we find critical bugs in Blocks UI?**
A: Rollback immediately, fix bugs in staging, re-deploy. 5-minute rollback time minimizes impact.

**Q: How do we know migration is successful?**
A: Error rate < 3%, load time < 3s, user satisfaction > 8/10, zero state loss, no rollback needed.
