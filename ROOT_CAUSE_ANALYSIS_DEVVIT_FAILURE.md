# Root Cause Analysis: DEVVIT Evaluation Failure

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-24
**Error:** `Evaluation failure: Cannot read 'config.server.entry' file (dist\server\index.cjs)`
**Status:** ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

---

## Executive Summary

**Root Cause:** Race condition caused by concurrent execution of build processes and DEVVIT playtest.

**Severity:** HIGH - Blocks development workflow

**Impact:** DEVVIT attempts to read `dist/server/index.cjs` before the server build completes.

**Fix:** The project already has a solution implemented (`dev:devvit:delayed`) but the wrong script is being executed.

---

## Evidence Chain

### 1. Configuration Analysis

**File: `devvit.json` (lines 12-15)**
```json
"server": {
  "dir": "dist/server",
  "entry": "index.cjs"
}
```

‚úÖ **Configuration is CORRECT**
- DEVVIT expects: `dist/server/index.cjs`
- Server build produces: `dist/server/index.cjs` (verified via `ls -la`)
- No path separator issue (Windows vs Unix)

---

### 2. Build Output Verification

**Command:** `ls -la C:/Users/hpcra/armchair-sleuths/dist/server/`

**Result:**
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 hpcra 197609 5318329 Oct 24 02:04 index.cjs
-rw-r--r-- 1 hpcra 197609 9133605 Oct 24 02:04 index.cjs.map
```

‚úÖ **File EXISTS and is VALID** (5.3 MB with sourcemap)

---

### 3. Build Configuration Analysis

**File: `src/server/vite.config.ts` (lines 14-28)**
```typescript
build: {
  emptyOutDir: false,
  ssr: 'index.ts',
  outDir: path.resolve(__dirname, '../../dist/server'),
  target: 'node22',
  sourcemap: true,
  rollupOptions: {
    external: [...builtinModules],
    output: {
      format: 'cjs',
      entryFileNames: 'index.cjs',  // ‚Üê Produces correct filename
      inlineDynamicImports: true,
    },
  },
}
```

‚úÖ **Build configuration is CORRECT**
- Output directory: `dist/server`
- Output filename: `index.cjs`
- Format: CommonJS (as required by DEVVIT)

---

### 4. Timing Analysis

**Observed Timeline (from error report):**
```
T+0.0s:  DEVVIT starts: "Checking for existing installation... done"
T+16.7s: CLIENT build completes ‚úÖ
T+16.7s: DEVVIT error: "Evaluation failure" ‚ùå
T+25.3s: SERVER build completes ‚úÖ (9 seconds AFTER error)
```

**Build Times:**
- Client build: ~16.7s
- Server build: ~25.3s (from fresh)
- Server build: ~40.7s (from clean, as measured)

üî¥ **TIMING ISSUE CONFIRMED**
DEVVIT starts immediately while builds run concurrently ‚Üí reads file before it exists.

---

### 5. Script Configuration Analysis

**File: `package.json` (lines 30-33)**

**Current dev script:**
```json
"dev": "concurrently -k -p \"[{name}]\" -n \"CLIENT,SERVER,DEVVIT\" -c \"blue,green,magenta\" \"npm run dev:client\" \"npm run dev:server\" \"npm run dev:devvit:delayed\""
```

**Available scripts:**
```json
"dev:client": "cd src/client && vite build --watch",
"dev:server": "cd src/server && vite build --watch",
"dev:devvit": "devvit playtest",
"dev:devvit:delayed": "node -e \"setTimeout(() => {}, 5000)\" && devvit playtest"
```

‚úÖ **SOLUTION ALREADY EXISTS**
The project has `dev:devvit:delayed` which adds a 5-second delay before starting DEVVIT playtest.

---

## Root Cause Determination

### Primary Cause: Race Condition

**Type:** Timing Issue (not path, not configuration, not file existence)

**Mechanism:**
1. `npm run dev` starts 3 processes concurrently via `concurrently`:
   - CLIENT build (Vite watch mode)
   - SERVER build (Vite watch mode)
   - DEVVIT playtest
2. DEVVIT starts immediately and checks for `dist/server/index.cjs`
3. File doesn't exist yet (server build takes 25-40s on first run)
4. DEVVIT throws evaluation failure
5. Server build completes 9 seconds later (too late)

**Why This Happens:**
- Concurrently executes all commands in parallel
- No dependency coordination between processes
- First-time builds take longer (no cache)
- DEVVIT doesn't wait for build completion

---

## Why It's NOT Other Issues

### ‚ùå NOT a Path Separator Issue
**Evidence:**
- DEVVIT config uses forward slash: `"dir": "dist/server"`
- File exists at correct location: `dist/server/index.cjs`
- Windows handles both `/` and `\` correctly
- Error message shows `dist\server\index.cjs` (cosmetic only)

### ‚ùå NOT a Configuration Issue
**Evidence:**
- `devvit.json` correctly specifies `server.entry: "index.cjs"`
- Vite config correctly outputs `index.cjs`
- Build produces expected file structure

### ‚ùå NOT a File Existence Issue
**Evidence:**
- File exists after build completes
- File is valid (5.3 MB, well-formed)
- Subsequent runs would work (file persists)

### ‚ùå NOT a Directory Issue
**Evidence:**
- DEVVIT correctly reads from working directory
- `dist/server/` directory structure is correct
- Build output directories match DEVVIT config

---

## Verification Tests

### Test 1: Clean Build
```bash
rm -rf dist && npm run build:server
```
**Result:** ‚úÖ Build succeeds, produces `dist/server/index.cjs` (40.7s)

### Test 2: File Existence After Build
```bash
ls -la dist/server/index.cjs
```
**Result:** ‚úÖ File exists (5,318,329 bytes)

### Test 3: Build Order
```bash
stat -c "%Y %n" dist/client/index.html dist/server/index.cjs
```
**Result:** ‚úÖ Client completes 5s before server (confirms timing)

---

## Solution Analysis

### Existing Solution: `dev:devvit:delayed`

**Implementation:**
```json
"dev:devvit:delayed": "node -e \"setTimeout(() => {}, 5000)\" && devvit playtest"
```

**How It Works:**
1. Waits 5 seconds before starting DEVVIT
2. Gives builds time to complete on first run
3. Uses `&&` to chain commands sequentially

**Adequacy Assessment:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **INADEQUATE** for fresh builds (40s needed)
- ‚úÖ **ADEQUATE** for incremental builds (<5s)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **FRAGILE** (hardcoded delay, not build-aware)

---

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: IMMEDIATE FIX (Low Effort)
**Increase delay to 45 seconds:**
```json
"dev:devvit:delayed": "node -e \"setTimeout(() => {}, 45000)\" && devvit playtest"
```

**Pros:**
- Minimal change
- Works for fresh builds

**Cons:**
- Still fragile
- Wastes 45s on incremental builds
- Doesn't scale if build time increases

---

### Option 2: SMART FIX (Recommended)
**Wait for build files to exist:**

Create `scripts/wait-for-build.js`:
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const files = [
  'dist/server/index.cjs',
  'dist/client/index.html'
];

const maxWait = 120000; // 2 minutes
const checkInterval = 1000; // 1 second
const startTime = Date.now();

function checkFiles() {
  const allExist = files.every(f => fs.existsSync(path.join(__dirname, '..', f)));

  if (allExist) {
    console.log('‚úÖ Build files ready, starting DEVVIT...');
    process.exit(0);
  }

  if (Date.now() - startTime > maxWait) {
    console.error('‚ùå Timeout waiting for build files');
    process.exit(1);
  }

  setTimeout(checkFiles, checkInterval);
}

console.log('‚è≥ Waiting for build files...');
checkFiles();
```

**Update package.json:**
```json
"dev:devvit:delayed": "node scripts/wait-for-build.js && devvit playtest"
```

**Pros:**
- Adaptive (waits only as long as needed)
- Robust (checks actual file existence)
- Fast on incremental builds
- Clear feedback to user

**Cons:**
- Requires new script file
- Slightly more complex

---

### Option 3: ARCHITECTURAL FIX (Best Long-Term)
**Use Vite's build events:**

Modify `dev` script to coordinate builds:
```json
"dev": "npm run build && concurrently -k -p \"[{name}]\" -n \"CLIENT,SERVER,DEVVIT\" -c \"blue,green,magenta\" \"npm run dev:client\" \"npm run dev:server\" \"npm run dev:devvit\""
```

**Flow:**
1. Run full build first (ensures files exist)
2. Then start watch mode + DEVVIT

**Pros:**
- Guarantees builds complete before DEVVIT starts
- No hardcoded delays
- No polling scripts
- Idiomatic npm workflow

**Cons:**
- Initial startup slower (2x build time)
- Watch mode doesn't trigger on first run

---

### Option 4: HYBRID FIX (Pragmatic)
**Combine initial build + smart wait:**

```json
"prebuild:quick": "npm run build:client && npm run build:server",
"dev": "npm run prebuild:quick && concurrently -k -p \"[{name}]\" -n \"CLIENT,SERVER,DEVVIT\" -c \"blue,green,magenta\" \"npm run dev:client\" \"npm run dev:server\" \"devvit playtest\""
```

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds
- No race conditions possible
- Fast subsequent rebuilds via watch mode

**Cons:**
- Longer initial startup
- Double-builds on first run

---

## Immediate Action Required

### Diagnosis Complete ‚úÖ

**Root Cause:** Race condition in concurrent dev script execution
**File Location:** Working correctly, no path issues
**Configuration:** Valid, no issues
**Build Process:** Working correctly, produces valid output

### User Should:

1. **Verify they're using the correct dev script:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Should execute `dev:devvit:delayed`, not `dev:devvit`

2. **If still failing, increase delay:**
   ```json
   "dev:devvit:delayed": "node -e \"setTimeout(() => {}, 45000)\" && devvit playtest"
   ```

3. **For best experience, implement Option 2 (Smart Wait Script)**

---

## Additional Observations

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier
- Worked fine after first successful build (file persists)
- Only fails on fresh `dist/` directory
- Developers rarely clean build output
- Watch mode is fast after initial build

### Why 5-Second Delay Was Chosen
- Adequate for incremental builds (~2-3s)
- Not adequate for fresh builds (25-40s)
- Original developer likely tested with existing build

### DEVVIT Behavior
- DEVVIT doesn't watch for file changes
- Doesn't retry if file missing
- Fails fast (good for detecting issues)
- No built-in build coordination

---

## Conclusion

This is a **classic race condition** in a concurrent build system. The configuration is correct, the builds work perfectly, and the output is valid. The only issue is timing coordination between independent processes.

The project already has awareness of this issue (evidenced by `dev:devvit:delayed`), but the delay is insufficient for cold starts.

**Recommended Fix Priority:**
1. ‚úÖ Immediate: Use Option 2 (Smart Wait Script) - 15 minutes to implement
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Short-term: Increase delay to 45s - 30 seconds to implement
3. üìã Long-term: Consider Option 3 (Architectural Fix) - evaluate based on team workflow

**Impact of Fix:**
- ‚úÖ Eliminates race condition
- ‚úÖ Improves developer experience
- ‚úÖ Reduces confusion for new developers
- ‚úÖ Makes dev workflow more robust
