## 🚀 Getting Started Guide

### Step 1: Enable Hooks
```
Kiro IDE → Agent Hooks
→ assess-on-save: Enable
→ assess-on-task-complete: Enable
→ codify-on-project-complete: Enable
→ enhance-spec: Enable
```

### Step 2: Start First Project
```
"Create a user authentication system spec"
→ enhance-spec Hook automatically references past learnings
→ Enhanced Spec generated
```

### Step 3: Auto-Validation During Development
```
On file save:
→ assess-on-save Hook auto-executes
→ Immediate notification on issue discovery

On task completion:
→ "Task 1 complete. Please review"
→ assess-on-task-complete Hook executes
→ Review Multi-Review results
```

### Step 4: Record Learnings on Project Completion
```
"Project is complete. Please record learnings."
→ codify-on-project-complete Hook executes
→ Learning file auto-generated
→ Steering files auto-updated
```

### Step 5: Auto-Utilize in Next Project
```
On next project start:
→ Previous learnings auto-applied
→ Same mistakes prevented
→ Faster and easier development
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Hooks Don't Work
1. Check enabled in Kiro IDE → Agent Hooks
2. Verify hook file paths
3. Restart Kiro IDE

### If Learning Files Not Generated
1. Check codify-on-project-complete Hook enabled
2. Manually declare "Project complete"
3. Verify `.kiro/steering/learnings/` folder exists

### If Reviewers Don't Execute
1. Verify Reviewer file paths
2. Check assess-on-save Hook enabled
3. Wait briefly after file save
