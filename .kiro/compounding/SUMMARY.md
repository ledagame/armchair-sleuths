# Compounding Engineering System - Summary

**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Active  
**Pattern**: Similar to `/skills` folder - load only when needed

---

## ✅ System Refactored Successfully

### Before (Heavy Steering)
```
.kiro/steering/
├── compounding-engineering-patterns.md  # ❌ Always loaded (heavy)
└── README-COMPOUNDING-ENGINEERING.md    # ❌ Always loaded (heavy)
```

**Problems**:
- ❌ Heavy context usage (always loaded)
- ❌ Will grow unbounded over time
- ❌ Slows down every request
- ❌ Not scalable

---

### After (Lightweight Compounding Folder)
```
.kiro/compounding/                       # ✅ Load only when needed
├── README.md                            # Overview
├── SUMMARY.md                           # This file
├── core-principles/
│   ├── separation-of-concerns.md
│   ├── typescript-type-safety.md
│   └── framework-integration.md
├── design-patterns/
│   ├── business-logic-first.md
│   ├── interface-driven-design.md
│   └── event-driven-architecture.md
├── anti-patterns/
│   ├── framework-dependencies.md
│   ├── any-type-usage.md
│   └── god-classes.md
└── task-learnings/
    └── task-3-combat-system.md

.kiro/steering/
├── compounding-reference.md             # ✅ Lightweight reference
└── auto-task-validation.md              # ✅ Updated to use compounding/
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Light context usage (load only when needed)
- ✅ Scalable to hundreds of learnings
- ✅ Fast - only load relevant files
- ✅ Follows proven skills folder pattern

---

## 🔄 How It Works

### 1. Task Completion
Developer declares: "task3 완료"

### 2. Automatic Validation
System validates and extracts learnings

### 3. Save to Compounding Folder
```
.kiro/compounding/task-learnings/task-3-combat-system.md
```

### 4. Reference When Needed
```markdown
# In steering or during task execution
#[[file:.kiro/compounding/task-learnings/task-3-combat-system.md]]
```

### 5. Apply to Future Tasks
Next task references relevant learnings

## 📊 Current Content

### Core Principles (3)
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Business logic vs Presentation
2. **TypeScript Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time
3. **Framework Integration**: Leverage framework features

### Design Patterns (3)
1. **Business Logic First**: Implement core before UI
2. **Interface-Driven Design**: Define contracts first
3. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Loose coupling with events

### Anti-Patterns (3)
1. **Framework Dependencies**: Don't import frameworks in core
2. **Any Type Usage**: Don't bypass TypeScript
3. **God Classes**: Don't create classes with too many responsibilities

### Task Learnings (1)
1. **Task 3 - Combat System**: S grade, 100% completion

---

## 🎯 Usage Pattern

### For Developers

**Before Starting Task**:
```
1. Check task-learnings/ for similar tasks
2. Read relevant core-principles/
3. Review applicable design-patterns/
4. Note anti-patterns/ to avoid
```

**During Implementation**:
```
- Follow referenced patterns
- Avoid documented anti-patterns
- Note new patterns discovered
```

**After Completion**:
```
- System auto-extracts learnings
- System auto-saves to compounding/
- Review and confirm accuracy
```

---

## 🚀 Benefits vs Skills Folder

### Similar Pattern
- ✅ Both are separate folders
- ✅ Both load only when needed
- ✅ Both use file references
- ✅ Both scale indefinitely

### Differences
- **Skills**: External knowledge (Phaser, Reddit API, etc.)
- **Compounding**: Internal learnings (our patterns, our mistakes)

### Synergy
- Skills provide external best practices
- Compounding captures our specific learnings
- Together: Complete knowledge system

---

## 📈 Expected Growth

### Month 1 (Current)
- 1 task learning
- 3 core principles
- 3 design patterns
- 3 anti-patterns

### Month 3
- ~10 task learnings
- ~5 core principles
- ~8 design patterns
- ~8 anti-patterns

### Month 6
- ~30 task learnings
- ~8 core principles
- ~15 design patterns
- ~15 anti-patterns

### Impact
- ⬆️ Development speed increases
- ⬆️ Code quality increases
- ⬇️ Bug count decreases
- ⬇️ Context usage stays light (on-demand loading)

## 🎓 Philosophy

> **"Load only what you need, when you need it"**

This system:
- Captures all learnings (nothing lost)
- Loads only relevant learnings (efficient)
- Scales indefinitely (no context bloat)
- Follows proven patterns (skills folder)

---

## 📞 Next Steps

### For Current Project
1. ✅ System is ready to use
2. ✅ Task 3 learnings already captured
3. ✅ Next task will reference Task 3
4. ✅ Compounding effect begins

### For Future Tasks
1. Complete task
2. System auto-validates
3. System auto-saves to compounding/
4. Next task references learnings
5. Quality compounds over time

---

**Remember**: This system only works if we:
1. ✅ Complete task validations
2. ✅ Extract learnings
3. ✅ Save to compounding folder
4. ✅ Reference when needed
5. ✅ Apply to new tasks

**The more we use it, the more valuable it becomes!** 🚀
