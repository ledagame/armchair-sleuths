## Problem Analysis

### Current System Limitations

**What Works:**
- ✅ 5 well-defined archetypes with distinct personalities
- ✅ 4-tier emotional progression (COOPERATIVE → AGGRESSIVE)
- ✅ Guilty vs innocent behavioral differentiation
- ✅ YAML-based lazy loading architecture

**What's Missing:**
- ❌ Static responses - suspects react the same way regardless of specific evidence
- ❌ No memory - suspects don't remember or react to previous contradictions
- ❌ Monolithic structure - hard to reuse emotion patterns across archetypes
- ❌ Manual quality control - no automated validation of response quality

### Player Experience Gap

**Current Experience:**
> "I interrogated the wealthy heir for 10 questions. He was consistently dismissive. It felt generic."

**Desired Experience:**
> "When I mentioned the knife, the butler COMPLETELY changed - he went from cooperative to hostile instantly! Then I caught him contradicting his earlier alibi and he got flustered. It felt like a real interrogation!"

## Proposed Solution

### The Skill Layer Cascade System

A composable architecture where character behavior emerges from layered skills with clear precedence rules:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 5: Contradiction Memory          │  Priority: 1000
│  (Generated dynamically when caught)    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 4: Evidence Memory               │  Priority: 100
│  (Case-specific triggers)               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 3: Relationship Memory           │  Priority: 50
│  (Connection to victim)                 │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 2: Tactic Layer                  │  Priority: 10
│  (Guilty-evasion / Innocent-detail)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 1: Emotion Layer                 │  Priority: 5
│  (COOPERATIVE/NERVOUS/DEFENSIVE/...)    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Layer 0: Archetype Base                │  Priority: 1
│  (Personality, vocabulary, background)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓
    Composed Prompt → AI → Response → Validator
```

**Key Principle**: Higher priority layers can override lower layers, creating emergent behavior while maintaining character consistency.

## Core Innovations

### Innovation 1: Memory Skills (Evidence-Triggered Reactions)

**Concept**: Dynamic skills that activate when specific evidence or keywords are mentioned.

**Example Scenario:**

```yaml
# memories/evidence/bloody-knife-trauma.yaml
name: bloody-knife-trauma
type: evidence-memory
priority: 100

triggers:
  keywords: ["knife", "weapon", "blood", "blade"]
  evidence_ids: ["murder_weapon_001"]

effects:
  suspicion_modifier: +20      # Instant spike
  force_state: AGGRESSIVE      # Override current emotion
  duration_turns: 2            # Active for 2 responses

behavior_override:
  mindset: "Panic - the secret is exposed"
  mandatory_patterns:
    - "Immediate denial"
    - "Emotional outburst"
    - "Threaten to end conversation"
  forbidden_patterns:
    - "Calm explanation"
    - "Detailed response"
```

**Player Experience:**

```
Detective: "Tell me about this bloody knife we found."

[MEMORY SKILL ACTIVATES]

Butler (was COOPERATIVE, now AGGRESSIVE):
"I don't know anything about that! How DARE you suggest—
I'm done answering questions without my lawyer present!"

[Player sees dramatic shift, feels like they hit a nerve]
```

### Innovation 2: Atomic Skills (Composable Architecture)

**Concept**: Break monolithic archetype files into reusable atomic pieces.

**Current Structure (Monolithic):**
```
wealthy-heir.yaml (800 lines)
├── personality
├── vocabulary
└── speechPatterns
    ├── COOPERATIVE (100 lines)
    ├── NERVOUS (100 lines)
    ├── DEFENSIVE (100 lines)
    └── AGGRESSIVE (100 lines)
```

**Proposed Structure (Atomic):**
```
archetypes/base/
├── wealthy-heir-base.yaml (200 lines)
│   ├── personality
│   └── vocabulary
│
emotions/ (SHARED across all archetypes)
├── cooperative.yaml (50 lines)
├── nervous.yaml (50 lines)
├── defensive.yaml (50 lines)
└── aggressive.yaml (50 lines)
│
tactics/ (SHARED strategies)
├── guilty-evasion.yaml
└── innocent-detail.yaml
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fix `nervous.yaml` once → all 5 archetypes benefit
- ✅ Create new archetype in 200 lines instead of 800
- ✅ Test emotion behaviors independently
- ✅ Mix and match for character variants

### Innovation 3: AI-Powered Validator Skill

**Concept**: Replace hardcoded scoring logic with AI evaluation using quality criteria as a prompt.

**Current Approach:**
```typescript
// validate-quality.ts (200+ lines of complex logic)
archetypeScore = (
  vocabularyMatch * 0.3 +
  speechPatternMatch * 0.3 +
  valueAlignment * 0.2 +
  behaviorConsistency * 0.2
) * 100
```

**Proposed Approach:**
```typescript
// Hybrid: Fast checks + AI evaluation
const quickChecks = runBasicValidation(response);  // < 1ms
if (!quickChecks.passed) return fail;

const aiEvaluation = await validateWithAI({
  response,
  composition,
  criteria: qualityCriteria  // references/quality-criteria.md
});

return hybrid(quickChecks, aiEvaluation);
```

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Adjust criteria by editing markdown, not code
- ✅ AI catches nuanced issues code can't detect
- ✅ Explainable (AI provides reasoning)
- ✅ Fast failures don't waste AI calls

### Innovation 4: Contradiction Detection & Dynamic Memory Generation

**Concept**: Track suspect statements, detect contradictions, and generate memory skills at runtime.

**Flow:**

1. **Statement Tracking**
```typescript
// Turn 2
Player: "Where were you at 9pm?"
Suspect: "I was at home all evening."
System: [Records: {time:"9pm", location:"home", turn:2}]
```

2. **Contradiction Detection**
```typescript
// Turn 7
Player: "A witness saw you at Murphy's Bar at 9pm."
System: [Detects contradiction with Turn 2 statement]
System: [Generates memory-caught-in-lie-about-alibi.yaml]
```

3. **Dynamic Reaction**
```typescript
Suspect (was DEFENSIVE, now panicked):
"I... I may have stepped out briefly. I forgot.
It's been a confusing time."
System: [Suspicion +25, memory active for 3 turns]
```

**Player Experience:**
> "I caught him in a lie and he actually REACTED to it! This feels like I'm playing a real detective!"

### Innovation 5: Relationship Memory Skills

**Concept**: Character reactions vary based on relationship to victim.

```yaml
# memories/relationship/victim-was-sibling.yaml
name: victim-was-my-sister
type: relationship-memory
priority: 50

effects:
  baseline_emotion: +15  # Always more emotional

special_behaviors:
  - Uses victim's first name (intimate)
  - Switches between grief and anger
  - Personal anecdotes slip out
  - May show genuine emotion even if guilty

vocabulary_additions:
  - "my sister"
  - "she always..."
  - family-specific terms
```

## Appendix A: Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Evidence Memory Trigger

**Setup:**
- Suspect: Marcus Chen (Wealthy Heir)
- Guilty of murder
- Current state: NERVOUS (suspicion 45)
- Evidence: Bloody knife found in his study

**Interrogation:**

```
Turn 5:
Detective: "We found a bloody knife in your study."

[EVIDENCE MEMORY TRIGGERS: bloody-knife-trauma.yaml]
[Effects: suspicion +20 → 65 (DEFENSIVE), force AGGRESSIVE for 2 turns]

Marcus Chen (AGGRESSIVE override):
"That's RIDICULOUS! I don't know anything about that!
My lawyer will hear about this harassment!"

[Word count: 15 - appropriate for AGGRESSIVE]
[Player sees dramatic shift from nervous to hostile]
```

### Scenario 2: Contradiction Detection

**Setup:**
- Suspect: Eleanor Price (Loyal Butler)
- Innocent
- Current state: COOPERATIVE (suspicion 20)

**Interrogation:**

```
Turn 2:
Detective: "Where were you between 8pm and 10pm?"
Eleanor: "I was in the kitchen preparing tomorrow's meals.
I always do that on Thursday evenings."

[System records: {location: "kitchen", time: "8-10pm", turn: 2}]

Turn 8:
Detective: "A witness saw you leaving the house at 9pm."
Eleanor: "Oh... yes, I did step out briefly. I needed to post a letter."

[CONTRADICTION DETECTED]
[System generates: memory-caught-in-inconsistency.yaml]
[Effects: suspicion +15 → 35 (NERVOUS)]

Eleanor (NERVOUS, flustered):
"I apologize, Detective. I... I forgot about that.
It was just a quick errand. I'm sorry for the confusion."

[Player sees natural embarrassment - innocent person caught in mistake]
```

### Scenario 3: Layered Composition

**Setup:**
- Suspect: Richard Wu (Business Partner)
- Guilty
- Victim was his sister (relationship memory active)
- Just mentioned knife evidence (evidence memory active)
- Caught in contradiction (contradiction memory active)

**Active Layers:**
```
Layer 5: memory-contradiction-alibi (Priority 1000)
Layer 4: memory-bloody-knife (Priority 100)
Layer 3: memory-victim-was-sister (Priority 50)
Layer 2: tactic-guilty-evasion (Priority 10)
Layer 1: emotion-aggressive (Priority 5)
Layer 0: business-partner-base (Priority 1)
```

**Result:**
```
Detective: "So you say you weren't there, but we have evidence
you were AND we found the murder weapon in your office."

Richard Wu (cascading effects):
"My SISTER— I can't— This is... I need my lawyer. NOW.
I'm not discussing this without legal counsel present."

[Composition breakdown:]
- "My SISTER" - relationship memory (grief/anger mix)
- "I can't—" - evidence memory (panic at knife mention)
- Emotional interruption - contradiction memory (caught lying)
- "lawyer" - business partner vocabulary
- Short, hostile - AGGRESSIVE state
- Minimal info - guilty-evasion tactic

[Quality score: 88/100]
[Player experiences climactic interrogation moment]
```

name: bloody-knife-trauma
type: evidence-memory
priority: 100

description: |
  Panic reaction when the murder weapon (bloody knife) is mentioned.
  The suspect has a strong emotional reaction because this is the
  weapon they used to commit the murder.

# Trigger conditions
triggers:
  keywords:
    - "knife"
    - "blade"
    - "weapon"

description: |
  Template for dynamically generated contradiction memories.
  Created at runtime when the system detects the player has
  caught the suspect in a contradiction.

# This template gets filled in by ContradictionDetectionService
placeholders:
  - "{{CONTRADICTION_TOPIC}}"    # What they lied about
  - "{{ORIGINAL_STATEMENT}}"     # What they said before
  - "{{CURRENT_STATEMENT}}"      # What they just said

  duration_turns: 3
  cooldown_turns: 10

# Behavior override
behavior_override:
  mindset: |
    You've been caught in a contradiction about {{CONTRADICTION_TOPIC}}.
    Earlier (turn {{TURN_NUMBER}}) you said: "{{ORIGINAL_STATEMENT}}"
    But now you just said: "{{CURRENT_STATEMENT}}"
